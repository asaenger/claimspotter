1	0	Good evening to you all.
2	0	The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance.
3	0	Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question.
4	0	"For a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed."
5	0	"There are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers."
6	0	"We will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight, and we begin with opening statements, in alphabetical order, and Secretary Clinton."
7	0	"Well, thank you."
8	0	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
9	0	"You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top."
10	0	That's the job.
11	0	"I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night."
12	0	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
13	0	"From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made."
14	0	"They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it."
15	0	"They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class."
16	0	"And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns."
17	0	"So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people."
18	0	Thank you.
19	0	"Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
20	0	(APPLAUSE)
21	0	Governor O'Malley?
22	0	"Martha, thank you."
23	0	"Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us."
24	0	"So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States."
25	0	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
26	0	"And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans."
27	0	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
28	0	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
29	0	"What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger."
30	0	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
31	0	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
32	0	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
33	0	"But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths."
34	0	We are a better country than this.
35	0	"Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty."
36	0	And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
37	0	(APPLAUSE)
38	0	Senator Sanders.
39	0	Good evening.
40	0	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
41	0	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
42	0	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
43	0	"I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families."
44	0	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
45	0	"I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground."
46	0	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
47	0	(APPLAUSE)
48	0	Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all.
49	0	We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.
50	0	"Senator Sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign."""
51	0	"The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, ""our data was stolen."""
52	0	Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook?
53	0	"David, let me give you a little bit of background here."
54	0	The DNC has hired vendors.
55	0	"On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago."
56	0	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
57	0	"And when our staffers said, ""whoa, what's going here?"""
58	0	They went to the DNC quietly.
59	0	"They went to the vendor and said, ""hey, something is wrong,"" and that was quietly dealt with."
60	0	None of that information was looked at.
61	0	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
62	0	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
63	0	"There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign."
64	0	"In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information."
65	0	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
66	0	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
67	0	"Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem."
68	0	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
69	0	That is an egregious act.
70	0	"I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved."
71	0	"Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign."
72	0	Don't know that.
73	0	"But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that."
74	0	Last point.
75	0	"When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it."
76	0	"And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later."
77	0	"But Senator, you do mention the DNC -- the vender."
78	0	But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.
79	0	Absolutely.
80	0	Bernie Sanders apologizes to Hillary Clinton
81	0	"At ABC's Democratic presidential debate, candidate Bernie Sanders apologizes to rival Hillary Clinton for a scandal involving key voter data."
82	0	"So, does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight?"
83	0	"Yes, I apologize."
84	0	Secretary Clinton...
85	0	(APPLAUSE)
86	0	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
87	0	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
88	0	"And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired."
89	0	"Secretary Clinton, he has apologized."
90	0	How do your react?
91	0	"I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie."
92	0	It really is important that we go forward on this.
93	0	"I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen."
94	0	"Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us."
95	0	"And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on."
96	0	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
97	0	(APPLAUSE)
98	0	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
99	0	"Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare."
100	0	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
101	0	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
102	0	"Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids."
103	0	"Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth."
104	0	"Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party."
105	0	"We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table."
106	0	"And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward."
107	0	(APPLAUSE)
108	0	All three candidates are weighing in.
109	0	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
110	0	"You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails."
111	0	Right?
112	0	"And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues."
113	0	Media notwithstanding.
114	0	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
115	0	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
116	0	"Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders, let's move on right to some of those issues."
117	0	(APPLAUSE)
118	0	"It is just six days before Christmas, as we all know in this country."
119	0	"It's typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well."
120	0	But it's also an anxious time.
121	0	President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism.
122	0	"But we remember the president said, right before Thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland."
123	0	We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal.
124	0	They were not on law enforcement's radar.
125	0	They were completely undetected.
126	0	"So as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, Secretary Clinton, how confident should the American people be, that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?"
127	0	And what would you do as president to find them?
128	0	"Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe."
129	0	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
130	0	"Not to contain them, but to defeat them."
131	0	And it has three parts.
132	0	"First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq."
133	0	"Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism."
134	0	"And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe."
135	0	"Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do."
136	0	"Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground."
137	0	"Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond."
138	0	"And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right."
139	0	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
140	0	"That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence."
141	0	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
142	0	"They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists."
143	0	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
144	0	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
145	0	"Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization."
146	0	They will be our early warning signal.
147	0	"That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing."
148	0	"David, I am the very first..."
149	0	(inaudible) thank you.
150	0	(APPLAUSE)
151	0	I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor.
152	0	"I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders."
153	0	"Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing."
154	0	"Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies."
155	0	"I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo."
156	0	"We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future."
157	0	"And we're going to break down these issues tonight, but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant, as you know."
158	0	A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack.
159	0	How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?
160	0	I'm one of the 77 percent.
161	0	I think this is a very difficult issue.
162	0	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
163	0	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
164	0	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
165	0	"Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS."
166	0	What is the best way to do it?
167	0	"Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself."
168	0	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
169	0	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
170	0	"I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations."
171	0	"I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan."
172	0	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
173	0	"And Abdullah said something recently, very important."
174	0	"He said, ""Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."""
175	0	And I believe he is absolutely right.
176	0	"Senator, thank you."
177	0	"Secretary Clinton, in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control."
178	0	"But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism."
179	0	Are they wrong?
180	0	"Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us."
181	0	"Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take."
182	0	"You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that."
183	0	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
184	0	We also have to build a coalition at home.
185	0	"Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS."
186	0	I know how hard that is.
187	0	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
188	0	"Secretary Clinton, can we stick to gun control?"
189	0	"Yes, I'm getting..."
190	0	Are they wrong?
191	0	I'm getting to that.
192	0	"Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home."
193	0	"Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer."
194	1	"We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism."
195	0	I think what is...
196	0	(APPLAUSE)
197	0	"Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country."
198	0	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
199	0	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
200	0	"I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a ""clash of civilizations,"" that there is some kind of Western plot or even ""war against Islam,"" which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization."
201	0	"So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States."
202	0	(CROSSTALK)
203	0	"Senator Sanders -- wait just a moment, please, Governor O'Malley."
204	0	"Senator Sanders, we've seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the Paris attacks."
205	0	Would you discourage people from buying a gun?
206	0	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
207	0	"I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners."
208	0	That's the right of people.
209	0	But this is what I do believe.
210	0	"I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations."
211	0	"For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check."
212	0	Who denies that it is crazy...
213	0	(APPLAUSE)
214	0	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
215	0	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
216	0	"In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians."
217	0	I think there is a consensus.
218	0	(APPLAUSE)
219	0	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
220	0	It's a divided country on guns.
221	0	"But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together."
222	0	"Martha, if I may..."
223	0	"Thank you, Senator Sanders."
224	0	(CROSSTALK)
225	0	I think we're going to go on...
226	0	"Excuse me, no."
227	0	"Governor, we have to abide the rules here, we'll call on you here shortly, but..."
228	0	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
229	0	But I do want pick up on something...
230	0	"... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David."
231	0	"And, look, there are profound differences..."
232	0	(APPLAUSE)
233	1	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
234	1	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
235	1	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
236	1	"Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards."
237	0	"Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls."
238	0	We need more principle.
239	0	"When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up."
240	0	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
241	0	"Governor, now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute, then."
242	0	You talk about assault weapons.
243	0	"Even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow, Americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles."
244	0	"Would you make it illegal to own those weapons, force people to turn them in?"
245	0	"And if not, how would banning the sales really make a difference?"
246	0	"Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons."
247	0	"You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet..."
248	0	"But, again, I'm not talking about buying."
249	0	Would you have them confiscated?
250	0	The ones that are already here?
251	0	"No, Martha, I would not."
252	0	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
253	0	But you know what we did in Maryland?
254	0	We overcame the NRA's objections.
255	0	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
256	0	We did our own rallies.
257	0	"And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country."
258	0	"ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show."
259	0	"And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years."
260	0	"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
261	0	"Let's calm down a little bit, Martin."
262	0	"Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin."
263	0	I am telling the truth.
264	0	"First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators."
265	0	We will.
266	0	(LAUGHTER)
267	0	All right.
268	0	"But let me just establish that for you, senator."
269	0	"Really quickly governor, we are going to call on you tonight and it's very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until you're called upon."
270	0	"And senator, he invoked your record and I'll let you respond."
271	0	He sure did.
272	0	I'll let you respond.
273	0	He invoked mine as well.
274	0	And you will get some to as well.
275	0	Sure did.
276	0	All right.
277	0	"First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus."
278	0	"In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House."
279	0	"We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race."
280	0	"One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly."
281	0	"Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders."
282	0	I lost that election by three percentage points.
283	0	"Quite likely, for that reason."
284	0	"So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control."
285	0	(CROSSTALK)
286	0	Excuse me.
287	0	"Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety."
288	0	(APPLAUSE)
289	0	"Senator, thank you."
290	0	I want to move on here.
291	0	"Secretary Clinton, you brought up Donald Trump a short time ago."
292	0	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
293	0	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
294	0	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
295	0	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
296	0	"I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons."
297	0	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
298	0	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
299	0	"I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby."
300	0	"And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity."
301	0	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
302	0	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
303	0	"We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem."
304	0	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
305	0	(APPLAUSE)
306	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
307	0	We're going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago.
308	0	You brought up Donald Trump first here this evening.
309	0	We've now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on Muslims coming to America.
310	0	"Thirty-six percent of Americans, more than a third, agree with him."
311	0	You have weighed in already on Donald Trump.
312	0	You've weighed in on the proposed ban.
313	0	But what would you say to the millions of Americans watching tonight who agree with him?
314	0	Are they wrong?
315	0	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
316	0	"First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino."
317	0	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
318	0	"So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face."
319	0	"We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear."
320	0	Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
321	0	"You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks."
322	0	"One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together."
323	0	"You are not our adversary, you are our partner."
324	0	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
325	0	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
326	1	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
327	0	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
328	0	"Secretary, thank you."
329	0	"Senator Sanders, I did want to ask you about a neighbor in San Bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couple's home, that it set off red flags, but they didn't report it because they were afraid to profile."
330	0	What would you say to Americans afraid to profile?
331	0	Is it ever acceptable?
332	0	"Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it."
333	0	That's kind of a no-brainer.
334	0	"You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911."
335	0	Do it.
336	0	(LAUGHTER)
337	0	But I'm asking about -- I'm asking about profiling.
338	0	Because a lot of people are afraid of that.
339	0	"But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points."
340	0	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
341	0	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
342	0	They are anxious on a number of levels.
343	0	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
344	0	We all understand that.
345	0	But you know what else they're anxious about?
346	0	"They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent."
347	0	"And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?"
348	0	What are you going to do for my kids?
349	0	"And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, ""I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims."""
350	0	"Meanwhile, the rich get richer."
351	0	"So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea."
352	0	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
353	0	"I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from."
354	0	"Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top."
355	0	(APPLAUSE)
356	0	"Senator, thank you."
357	0	I want to move to another...
358	0	"Martha, may I -- Martha, may I..."
359	0	(CROSSTALK)
360	0	"No, no, not yet, Governor O'Malley."
361	0	Can I share this quick story?
362	0	"No, not yet, Governor O'Malley."
363	0	Oh.
364	0	All right.
365	0	I'll come to you when we call on you.
366	0	Thank you very much.
367	0	"When you come back to me, I'll share that story."
368	0	You'll be happy.
369	0	I'll let -- I'll let you talk then.
370	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption."
371	0	"FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order."
372	0	"You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data."
373	0	So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?
374	0	I would not want to go to that point.
375	0	"I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners."
376	0	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
377	0	There must be some way.
378	0	"I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts."
379	0	"And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that."
380	0	"But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something."
381	0	"I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out."
382	0	"Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after."
383	0	"So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe."
384	0	"And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve."
385	0	"And Governor O'Malley, where do you draw the line between national security and personal security?"
386	0	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
387	0	We need to figure this out together.
388	0	We need a collaborative approach.
389	0	We need new leadership.
390	0	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
391	0	The federal government should have to get warrants.
392	0	"That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms."
393	0	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
394	0	"My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves."
395	0	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
396	0	And he is a proud American Muslim.
397	0	"And one of his little boys said to him, ""Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"""
398	0	"These are very, very real issues."
399	0	Тhis is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
400	0	"We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression."
401	0	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
402	0	"Thank you, Governor O'Malley."
403	0	"Martha, we're going to turn now to refugees coming to America."
404	0	"And on the subject of refugees, more than half of all Americans now say they oppose taking in refugees from Syria and across the Middle East."
405	0	"Secretary Clinton, you have said that it would undermine who we are as Americans, shutting our doors."
406	0	"But New Hampshire's governor, where we are right here tonight, a democrat and a supporter of yours, is among more than 30 governors who are now concerned."
407	0	"Governor Maggie Hassan says, ""we should halt acceptance of Syrian refugees until U.S. authorities can assure the vetting process, halt Syrian refugees."""
408	0	Is she wrong?
409	0	"Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting..."
410	0	But a halt?
411	0	I don't think a halt is necessary.
412	0	"What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening."
413	0	"Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years."
414	0	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
415	0	"But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible."
416	0	"Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values."
417	0	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
418	0	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
419	0	"And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go."
420	0	I would prioritize them.
421	0	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
422	0	"Governor O'Malley, obviously you were governor yourself at one time."
423	0	What would you say to New Hampshire's governor tonight?
424	0	Is she wrong on this?
425	0	"No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept."
426	0	"And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more."
427	0	So the idea of a halt or a pause?
428	0	(APPLAUSE)
429	0	"David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees."
430	0	"I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months."
431	0	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
432	0	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
433	0	"What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now."
434	0	"The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators."
435	0	"We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values."
436	0	"Governor, thank you."
437	0	"Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, we're going to move on."
438	0	We're going to move on.
439	0	Excuse me.
440	0	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
441	0	We're going to move on to the fight against ISIS.
442	0	You're the one who told us we have to follow the rules and break it off.
443	0	(LAUGHTER)
444	0	"Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it."
445	0	All right.
446	0	(LAUGHTER)
447	0	OK. Let's keep going.
448	0	Thank you.
449	0	All right.
450	0	Let's keep going.
451	0	OK.
452	0	Thank you.
453	0	I do want to move to the fight against ISIS.
454	0	Yeah.
455	0	"For the people of New Hampshire, the brutality of ISIS is personal."
456	0	James Foley grew up here.
457	0	"The first hostage, a journalist, brutally executed last year."
458	0	You've all said ISIS is a ruthless enemy and must be stopped.
459	0	Al Qaida as well.
460	0	"Senator Sanders, you voted to send U.S. ground forces to fight in the coalition to help destroy Al Qaida in Afghanistan."
461	0	Can you then explain you why don't support sending U.S. combat troops to join a coalition to fight ISIS?
462	0	"And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country."
463	0	"I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war."
464	0	"And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops."
465	0	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
466	0	"But why Al Qaida, why not ISIS?"
467	0	"I have a problem with that, Martha."
468	0	"What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort."
469	0	"But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah."
470	0	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
471	0	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
472	0	They should be Muslim troops.
473	0	"I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support."
474	0	The administration has tried that over and over again.
475	0	"If it doesn't work and this threat is so great, what's your plan B?"
476	0	"My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS."
477	0	"To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep."
478	0	(APPLAUSE)
479	0	"Secretary Clinton, you too have ruled out a large U.S. combat force, yet you support sending in special operations forces to Syria, and sending those 100 to 200 troops to Iraq to do exploitation kill raids."
480	0	We've already lost one Delta Force member in a raid.
481	0	It has looked very much to me like we're already in ground combat on frequent trips I've made there.
482	0	"So, are you fooling Americans when you say, we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq?"
483	0	No.
484	0	Not at all.
485	0	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
486	0	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
487	0	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
488	0	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
489	0	We went after those who had attacked us.
490	0	"What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS."
491	0	"And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants."
492	0	They've advertised that.
493	0	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
494	0	"They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity."
495	0	"So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS."
496	0	And we do have to form a coalition.
497	0	I know how hard that is.
498	0	I have formed them.
499	0	"I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran."
500	0	And you have to really work hard at it.
501	0	"And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition."
502	0	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
503	0	(APPLAUSE)
504	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want -- I want to follow up on that."
505	0	You do support sending special operations forces there.
506	0	You support what the president has done already.
507	0	One of the lessons people draw from Vietnam and war since is that a little force can turn into a little more and a little more.
508	0	"President Obama certainly didn't expect to be sending 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan the first year of his presidency."
509	0	"Are you prepared to run the risk of a bigger war to achieve your goals to destroy ISIS, or are you prepared to give up on those goals if it requires a larger force?"
510	0	"Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice."
511	0	"I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS."
512	0	"So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president."
513	0	Governor O'Malley.
514	0	(APPLAUSE)
515	0	You've emphasized the need for more human intelligence on the ground.
516	0	What is it our intelligence community is not doing now that needs to be done?
517	0	"Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground."
518	0	"And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence."
519	0	"I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward."
520	0	"So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this."
521	0	"As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member."
522	0	"We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said."
523	0	"And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat."
524	0	"They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq."
525	0	"We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail."
526	0	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
527	0	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
528	0	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
529	0	"Well, I just want to quickly add..."
530	0	Thank you.
531	0	"Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS."
532	0	"And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space."
533	0	"I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition."
534	0	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
535	0	"Secretary Clinton, I'd like to go back to that if I could."
536	0	"ISIS doesn't have aircraft, Al Qaida doesn't have aircraft."
537	0	So would you shoot down a Syrian military aircraft or a Russian airplane?
538	0	I do not think it would come to that.
539	0	We are already de-conflicting air space.
540	0	We know...
541	0	"But isn't that a decision you should make now, whether..."
542	0	"No, I don't think so."
543	0	I am advocating...
544	0	... if you're advocating this?
545	0	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
546	0	"Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations."
547	0	"The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia."
548	0	"If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs."
549	0	(CROSSTALK)
550	0	"I want to take this to Senator -- I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders next, because I think there..."
551	0	(CROSSTALK)
552	0	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
553	0	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
554	0	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
555	0	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
556	0	I voted against the war.
557	0	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
558	0	"Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region."
559	0	"Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS."
560	0	"Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS."
561	0	"So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy."
562	0	"But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after."
563	0	"And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator."
564	0	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
565	0	That's the secondary issue.
566	0	That is exactly...
567	0	"Senator, thank you."
568	0	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
569	0	"Yeah, but, Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton..."
570	0	"And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that."
571	0	"And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya."
572	0	"You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution."
573	0	All of these are very difficult issues.
574	0	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
575	0	"And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned."
576	0	"But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria."
577	0	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
578	0	I was not the secretary of state...
579	0	"Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, hold on."
580	0	"One moment, please."
581	0	"I'm going to ask the secretary here, because there does appear to be some daylight here between the policies, at least in respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad."
582	0	Right now or do you wait?
583	0	Do you tackle ISIS first?
584	0	"You have said, Secretary Clinton, that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once."
585	0	"We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries, including Russia and Iran, to destroy ISIS first."
586	0	Is he wrong?
587	0	I think we're missing the point here.
588	0	We are doing both at the same time.
589	0	"But that's what he's saying, we should put that aside for now and go after ISIS."
590	0	"Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing."
591	0	We now have that.
592	0	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
593	0	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
594	0	"And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this."
595	0	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
596	0	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
597	0	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
598	0	"The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future."
599	0	(CROSSTALK)
600	0	I happen to think...
601	0	I'd like to offer a...
602	0	(APPLAUSE)
603	0	She says we have to proceed on both fronts at once.
604	0	Secretary Clinton is right.
605	0	This is a complicated issue.
606	0	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
607	0	But this is what I do believe.
608	0	"Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator."
609	0	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
610	0	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
611	0	It is ISIS.
612	0	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
613	0	"The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS."
614	0	(APPLAUSE)
615	0	"And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS."
616	0	"And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections."
617	0	"First priority, destroy ISIS."
618	0	"Senator sanders, thank you."
619	0	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
620	0	Governor O'Malley?
621	0	"During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey."
622	0	"We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States."
623	0	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
624	0	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
625	0	"I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves."
626	0	"I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart."
627	0	"And the world, no doubt is a better place without him."
628	0	"But look, we didn't know what was happening next."
629	0	"And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go."
630	0	We have a role to play in this world.
631	0	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
632	0	But -- you criticized -- you criticized Secretary Clinton for what came next.
633	0	What's your proposal for what comes after Assad?
634	0	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
635	0	That is the clear and present danger.
636	0	"And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process."
637	0	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
638	0	"Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?"
639	0	We have a role to play in this world.
640	0	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
641	0	(CROSSTALK)
642	0	David...
643	0	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
644	0	(LAUGHTER)
645	0	"I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians."
646	0	"The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad."
647	0	"I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now."
648	0	"And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or."
649	0	"I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute."
650	0	No.
651	0	We now finally are where we need to be.
652	0	"We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region..."
653	0	Secretary...
654	0	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
655	0	Could I just say -- just say this...
656	0	"If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader."
657	0	There is a vacuum.
658	0	Can I just say this...
659	0	"And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful."
660	0	(APPLAUSE)
661	0	"Senator Sanders, please."
662	0	Go ahead.
663	0	"Senator Sanders, a last word on this."
664	0	Of course the United States must lead.
665	0	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
666	0	The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
667	0	"The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS."
668	0	"ISIS, now, is the major priority."
669	0	Let's get rid of Assad later.
670	0	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
671	0	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
672	0	"Senator Sanders, thank you."
673	0	"When we come back here tonight, the other major issues of this election: jobs, the economy, health care."
674	0	"Which candidates will make the best case for the middle class, as our coverage of the Democratic debate, here in New Hampshire, continues right after this on ABC."
675	0	ABC News coverage of the New Hampshire Democratic debate will continue in a moment.
676	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
677	0	Welcome back tonight.
678	0	"As you can see, we have a packed audience here in New Hampshire and we're going to continue."
679	0	"We've already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about ISIS, about the concerns of terror here on the homefront and as we await Secretary Clinton backstage, we're going to begin on the economy."
680	0	"We want to turn to the American jobs, wages and raises in this country."
681	0	And we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute.
682	0	But in the mean time we want to start with this eye-opening number.
683	0	"And Senator Sanders, this question goes to you first, anyway."
684	0	"In 1995, the median American household income was $52,600 in today's money."
685	0	"This year, it's $53,600."
686	0	That's 20 more years on the job with just a 2 percent raise.
687	0	"In a similar time-frame, raises for CEOs went up more than 200 percent."
688	0	(APPLAUSE)
689	0	Sorry.
690	0	"We're going to continue here, and Secretary, you'll get a chance on this too."
691	0	"But as I pointed out the CEO pay, 200 percent of their time -- for that family of just 2 percent."
692	0	"You've all said, ""you would raise the minimum wage."""
693	0	But Senator Sanders what else - speak to that household tonight.
694	0	"20 years, just a 2 percent raise, how as president would you get them a raise right away?"
695	0	"First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated."
696	0	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
697	0	Absolutely.
698	0	"But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids."
699	0	So what do we do?
700	0	"First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, ""they cannot have it all."""
701	0	"For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes."
702	0	"Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years."
703	0	"Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers."
704	0	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
705	0	"Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts."
706	0	"We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment."
707	0	"Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world."
708	0	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
709	0	"Senator Sanders, thank you."
710	0	"Governor O'Malley, what would propose that would be different, how would you get the middle class a raise and without waiting another 20 years for another 2 percent."
711	0	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
712	0	We actually passed a living wage.
713	0	We raised the minimum wage.
714	0	"We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state."
715	0	"All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families."
716	0	How?
717	0	By actually doing more for education.
718	0	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
719	0	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
720	0	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
721	0	"We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices."
722	0	"So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there."
723	0	"We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families."
724	0	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
725	0	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
726	0	"Governor, thank you."
727	0	Secretary Clinton...
728	0	(APPLAUSE)
729	0	"As you were walking in, I was talking about the median American household getting a two percent raise over the last 20 years, that CEO pay in that same time frame has gone up 200 percent."
730	0	"So for those families watching tonight, how do you get them a raise if you're president?"
731	0	"Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy."
732	0	"It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences."
733	0	"I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president."
734	0	(APPLAUSE)
735	1	"They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes."
736	0	"At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up."
737	0	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
738	0	"Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits."
739	0	(APPLAUSE)
740	0	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
741	0	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
742	0	"That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities."
743	0	(APPLAUSE)
744	0	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
745	0	"I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down."
746	0	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
747	0	And there's a lot.
748	0	You can go to my website...
749	0	Secretary...
750	0	"... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it."
751	0	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
752	0	"Secretary, thank you."
753	0	(APPLAUSE)
754	0	This is the election...
755	0	We're going to -- we're going to...
756	0	... issues they have to respond to.
757	0	And we're going to talk about college education in a moment.
758	0	"But Secretary Clinton, I did want to ask you, the last time you ran for president, Fortune Magazine put you on its cover with the headline Business Loves Hillary, pointing out your support for many CEOs in corporate America."
759	0	"I'm curious, eight years later, should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?"
760	0	Everybody should.
761	0	(LAUGHTER)
762	0	(APPLAUSE)
763	0	"Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful."
764	0	"I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing."
765	0	"I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases."
766	0	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
767	0	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
768	0	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
769	0	"My dad was a small businessman, a really small business."
770	0	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
771	0	"So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had."
772	0	"Secretary, thank you."
773	0	Senator Sanders...
774	0	(APPLAUSE)
775	0	I want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate America play in a healthy economy and will corporate America love a President Sanders?
776	0	"No, I think they won't."
777	0	(LAUGHTER)
778	0	(APPLAUSE)
779	0	So Hillary and I have a difference.
780	0	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
781	0	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
782	0	(APPLAUSE)
783	0	"And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street."
784	0	"When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up."
785	0	So I don't think...
786	0	(APPLAUSE)
787	0	"... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street."
788	0	I don't have a super PAC.
789	0	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
790	0	"And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans."
791	0	"We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen."
792	0	"Senator, thank you."
793	0	I want to...
794	0	(APPLAUSE)
795	0	(CROSSTALK)
796	0	"Governor, let me just ask you, though, because it is an important question, how important a role do you think corporate America plays in a healthy economy here in the U.S.?"
797	0	"Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem."
798	0	"And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow."
799	0	"And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that."
800	0	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
801	0	"We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism."
802	0	"And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has."
803	0	"In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11."
804	0	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
805	0	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
806	1	"And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot."
807	0	"And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes."
808	0	"And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors..."
809	0	OK...
810	0	"Governor O'Malley, thank you."
811	0	(CROSSTALK)
812	0	"I do want to ask you, Secretary Clinton."
813	0	Let me just ask you...
814	0	Let me respond...
815	0	"We did -- we did -- Secretary Clinton, let me just ask you..."
816	0	(CROSSTALK)
817	0	"Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly."
818	0	Number one...
819	0	And in particular...
820	0	(CROSSTALK)
821	0	"Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire."
822	0	They started in Iowa.
823	0	"Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?"
824	0	"And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda."
825	1	"Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world."
826	0	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
827	1	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
828	0	(APPLAUSE)
829	0	"Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors."
830	0	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
831	0	"So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day."
832	0	"And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders."
833	0	"So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American."
834	0	"And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing."
835	0	Let me just -- let me just...
836	0	"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
837	0	Let me just jump in.
838	0	My name was invoked.
839	0	Senator?
840	0	"So with that invocation, let me say a few words."
841	0	(LAUGHTER)
842	0	"Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC."
843	0	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
844	0	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
845	0	"But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com."
846	0	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
847	0	(LAUGHTER)
848	0	"And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't."
849	0	(LAUGHTER)
850	0	"Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies."
851	0	What a brilliant idea that would be.
852	0	Go to YouTube.
853	0	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
854	0	"At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities."
855	0	Wall Street today has too much political power.
856	0	It has too much economic power.
857	0	"To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period."
858	0	Senator Sanders...
859	0	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
860	0	They've got to be broken up.
861	0	(APPLAUSE)
862	0	"Thank you, Senator."
863	0	And we're going to move on to health care.
864	0	"Secretary Clinton, the Department of Health and Human Services says more than 17 million Americans who are not insured now have health coverage because of Obamacare."
865	0	"But for Americans who already had health insurance the cost has gone up 27 percent in the last five years while deductibles are up 67 percent, health care costs are rising faster than many Americans can manage."
866	0	What's broken in Obamacare that needs to be fixed right now?
867	0	And what would you do to fix it?
868	0	"Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced."
869	0	"Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care."
870	0	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
871	0	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
872	0	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
873	0	(APPLAUSE)
874	0	Those are all really positive developments.
875	0	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
876	0	"And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those."
877	0	"Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems."
878	0	(APPLAUSE)
879	0	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
880	0	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
881	0	"And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha."
882	0	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
883	0	(CROSSTALK)
884	0	But you did say those were glitches.
885	0	Yes.
886	0	Just glitches?
887	0	"Well, they're glitches because..."
888	0	"Twenty-seven percent in the last five years, deductibles up 67 percent?"
889	0	It is.
890	0	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
891	0	"We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan."
892	0	I know.
893	0	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
894	0	We want to build on it and fix it.
895	0	And I'm confident we can do that.
896	0	And it will have effects in the private market.
897	0	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
898	0	"And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals."
899	0	"Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system."
900	0	(CROSSTALK)
901	0	"Senator Sanders, I want you to respond to what she was saying, but you're instead calling for single-payer health care."
902	0	"Yes, exactly, exactly."
903	0	You note people won't have to pay deductibles or premiums but they will have to pay new taxes.
904	0	Can you tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay?
905	0	"Yes, well, roughly."
906	0	Let me say this.
907	0	"As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward."
908	0	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
909	0	It is a step forward.
910	0	A step forward.
911	0	But this is what we also have to say.
912	0	"Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor."
913	0	Major crisis and primary health care.
914	0	Here is the bottom line.
915	0	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
916	0	Why is it...
917	0	(APPLAUSE)
918	0	"Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes."
919	0	Bottom line.
920	0	This ties into campaign finance reform.
921	0	"The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress."
922	0	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
923	0	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
924	0	"Senator Sanders, you didn't really tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay..."
925	0	"But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance."
926	0	So it's unfair to say in total...
927	0	"But you can't tell us this specifically, even if you were..."
928	0	"I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance."
929	0	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
930	0	OK.
931	0	"Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque."
932	0	Neil?
933	0	Here to New Hampshire again.
934	0	"As you know, this auditorium is filled with many Saint Anselm college students."
935	0	They know the outstanding student debt right now in America is $1.3 trillion.
936	0	"That private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent, and 40 percent for public education."
937	0	"So knowing that, we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost?"
938	0	"Senator Sanders, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges."
939	0	And universities.
940	0	How does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers?
941	0	"Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach."
942	0	And your point is absolutely well taken.
943	0	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
944	0	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
945	0	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
946	0	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
947	0	But...
948	0	(APPLAUSE)
949	0	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
950	0	"But, bottom line is this is the year 2015."
951	0	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
952	0	"It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them."
953	0	"Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt."
954	0	What do we do?
955	0	"My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt."
956	0	"You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent."
957	0	What sense is that?
958	0	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
959	0	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
960	0	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
961	0	(APPLAUSE)
962	0	"Governor O'Malley, how do you propose -- Governor O'Malley, how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?"
963	0	"Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this."
964	0	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
965	0	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
966	0	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
967	0	"Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance."
968	0	But states need to do more as well.
969	0	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
970	0	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
971	0	"I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace."
972	0	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
973	0	"Man (ph), their mother's here as well."
974	0	"We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?"
975	0	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
976	0	"I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones."
977	0	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
978	0	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
979	0	Bill.
980	0	"But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills."
981	0	That's a drag on the economy.
982	0	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
983	0	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
984	0	"And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid."
985	0	Secretary Clinton.
986	0	Right.
987	0	"Secretary Clinton, how does your plan differentiate from your opponents?"
988	0	"Well, I have what I call the new college compact."
989	0	"Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know."
990	0	"Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education."
991	0	"In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country."
992	0	"So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education."
993	0	"So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system."
994	0	"Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody."
995	0	"I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead."
996	0	"So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense."
997	0	"So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response."
998	0	"But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems."
999	0	"Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget."
1000	0	"And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run."
1001	0	"And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college."
1002	0	"Thank you Secretary Clinton, thank you."
1003	0	May I respond to the critique on the ...
1004	0	Back to you David.
1005	0	We're going to get right into this Senator but I want to ask about taxes next.
1006	0	This is included.
1007	0	I would just...
1008	0	She was asking about that...
1009	0	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
1010	0	"As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care."
1011	0	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
1012	0	"And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal."
1013	0	"Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders..."
1014	0	Are we back on health care - Secretary Clinton hold one moment.
1015	0	Senator Sanders...
1016	0	(CROSSTALK)
1017	0	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
1018	0	"Secretary Clinton, please."
1019	0	"And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families."
1020	0	I'm the only person...
1021	0	So let's ask about it.
1022	0	"Secretary Clinton, let's turn to the taxes."
1023	0	"... saying, no middle class tax raises."
1024	0	That's off the table...
1025	0	"This is where we are going next, we are going next to taxes here..."
1026	0	"Now, this is getting to be fun."
1027	0	This is fun.
1028	0	(APPLAUSE)
1029	0	This is democracy at work.
1030	0	"Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about your tax plan because from the crushing cost of college education, the next question most families have; is will my taxes go up under the next president?"
1031	0	"You have said it's your goal not to raise taxes on families making under $200,000 a year a goal."
1032	0	But can you say that's a promise as you stand here tonight?
1033	0	That is a pledge that I'm making.
1034	0	I made it when I ran in 2008.
1035	0	A promise?
1036	0	"Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made."
1037	0	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
1038	0	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
1039	0	"Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody."
1040	0	"And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now."
1041	0	Let me respond to...
1042	0	(APPLAUSE)
1043	0	Secretary Clinton...
1044	0	Let me respond to...
1045	0	Please.
1046	0	"Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own."
1047	0	"Now, when Secretary Clinton says, ""I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class,"" let me tell you what she is saying."
1048	0	"She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave."
1049	0	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
1050	0	"Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class."
1051	0	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
1052	0	"I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest."
1053	0	"Senator, thank you."
1054	0	Let me bring in Governor O'Malley...
1055	0	"Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid..."
1056	0	You've heard...
1057	0	... family leave for a very long time...
1058	0	Secretary Clinton.
1059	0	"David, thank you."
1060	0	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
1061	0	Then (inaudible)...
1062	0	... not everybody else.
1063	0	"Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave."
1064	0	Thank you.
1065	0	I want to bring in Governor O'Malley on this.
1066	0	"We heard the promise from Secretary Clinton because people want to know about their taxes, will they go up."
1067	0	"She has now promised here tonight not to raise them on families making $250,000 or less."
1068	0	Can you make that same promise if you're elected?
1069	0	"No, I've never made a promise like that."
1070	0	"But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year."
1071	0	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
1072	0	"By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started."
1073	0	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
1074	0	"David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave."
1075	0	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
1076	0	"And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits."
1077	0	"But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains."
1078	0	"If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again."
1079	0	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
1080	0	"That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how."
1081	0	"Governor O'Malley, thank you."
1082	0	A spirited debate on taxes.
1083	0	"And there will be more with the Democratic debate in New Hampshire, when we come back right here on ABC."
1084	0	More in a moment.
1085	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1086	0	Welcome back tonight to New Hampshire.
1087	0	The Democratic debate continues here on ABC.
1088	0	"And Secretary Clinton, we want to turn to race, now, in America."
1089	0	"There is a real concern in this country from Black Lives Matter and from other community groups that we're just now seeing, with smartphones and cell phones, what many have been dealing with for years when they come in contact with police."
1090	0	"But you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called Ferguson effect, police holding back because they're afraid of backlash."
1091	0	"In fact, the FBI director is calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement."
1092	0	"So, if elected president, how would you bridge the divide between the two?"
1093	0	"Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country."
1094	0	"We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended."
1095	0	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
1096	0	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
1097	0	"At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically."
1098	0	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
1099	0	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
1100	0	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
1101	0	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
1102	0	"And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust."
1103	0	"Secretary, thank you."
1104	0	(APPLAUSE)
1105	0	"Governor O'Malley, how would you bridge the divide?"
1106	0	"There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America."
1107	0	"When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America."
1108	0	But we came together.
1109	0	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
1110	0	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
1111	0	"As governor, we continued to work together."
1112	0	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
1113	0	But get this.
1114	0	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
1115	0	"So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police."
1116	0	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
1117	0	"We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force."
1118	0	"In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force."
1119	0	"As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable."
1120	0	"Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force."
1121	0	"There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better."
1122	0	We need to do it now as a nation.
1123	0	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
1124	0	"Governor, thank you."
1125	0	(APPLAUSE)
1126	0	"And Senator Sanders, when you hear the FBI director calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement, does that concern you as well when you --"
1127	0	"Well, this whole issue concerns me."
1128	0	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
1129	0	But let's be clear.
1130	0	"Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people."
1131	0	Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
1132	0	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
1133	0	"I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism."
1134	0	"We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system."
1135	0	"Now, what does that mean?"
1136	0	"Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans."
1137	0	(APPLAUSE)
1138	0	"It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act."
1139	0	So that it will not be a federal crime.
1140	0	That is why we need to make...
1141	0	(APPLAUSE)
1142	0	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
1143	0	"I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department."
1144	0	"And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force."
1145	0	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
1146	0	We need to end minimal sentencing.
1147	0	"We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration."
1148	0	(APPLAUSE)
1149	0	"Senator, thank you."
1150	0	We want to turn now to an issue.
1151	0	"This next issue has destroyed so many families across the country, and in particular right here in New Hampshire, heroin."
1152	0	And there's a stunning new figure out.
1153	0	"A recent poll -- 48 percent here, in this state alone, say they know someone who has abused heroin."
1154	0	We're going to turn tonight to Dan Tuohy of the New Hampshire Union Leader who has this question.
1155	0	"New Hampshire has been hard hit by the heroin epidemic, and we're on track to have twice as many overdose deaths this year as in 2013."
1156	0	What specifically would you do to address this crisis?
1157	0	"Senator Sanders, I'm going to take this to you first because you've seen what's happened with heroin right on the border in your own state."
1158	0	Yes.
1159	0	"Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire."
1160	0	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
1161	0	It is a tragedy all over this country.
1162	0	"The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly."
1163	0	What do we do?
1164	0	"Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin."
1165	0	"Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity."
1166	0	(APPLAUSE)
1167	0	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
1168	0	"When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help."
1169	0	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
1170	0	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
1171	0	"Senator, thank you."
1172	0	Secretary Clinton?
1173	0	"You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?"
1174	0	"And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose."
1175	0	"I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities."
1176	0	"So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard."
1177	0	"I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do."
1178	0	"And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out."
1179	0	"And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena."
1180	0	"So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together."
1181	0	"I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan."
1182	0	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
1183	0	"There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction."
1184	0	"And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go."
1185	0	"And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring."
1186	0	"Secretary, thank you."
1187	0	"And you know, I actually know a great deal about this issue."
1188	0	"And I have a dear friend, played music with him for years, remember when his -- when he came home with his baby girl, and now she's no longer with us, because of addiction and overdose."
1189	0	"The last time in New Hampshire, I had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose."
1190	0	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
1191	0	It's a huge public health challenge.
1192	0	"In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America."
1193	0	"But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing."
1194	0	"I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment."
1195	0	"We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital."
1196	0	"That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there."
1197	0	That's what I said to my own public health people.
1198	0	What would we do if this were ebola?
1199	0	How would we act?
1200	0	"So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act."
1201	0	There are thing that can be done.
1202	0	Go on to my website.
1203	0	My plan is there.
1204	0	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
1205	0	"Governor O'Malley, thank you."
1206	0	Martha?
1207	0	(APPLAUSE)
1208	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to circle back to something that your opponents here have brought up."
1209	0	Libya is falling apart.
1210	0	"The country is a haven for ISIS and jihadists with an estimated 2,000 ISIS fighters there today."
1211	0	You advocated for that 2011 intervention and called it smart power at its best.
1212	0	"And yet, even President Obama said the U.S. should have done more to fill the leadership vacuum left behind."
1213	0	How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed elections?
1214	0	"Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people."
1215	0	"The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi."
1216	0	"I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path."
1217	0	"Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do."
1218	0	"But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government."
1219	0	"You know, this is not easy work."
1220	0	We did a lot to help.
1221	0	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
1222	0	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
1223	0	"Secretary Clinton, I want to go back."
1224	0	That -- government lacked institutions and experience.
1225	0	It had been a family business for 40 years.
1226	0	"On the security side, we offered only a modest training effort and a very limited arms buy-back program."
1227	0	Let me ask you the question again.
1228	0	How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed those elections?
1229	0	"Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take."
1230	0	We offered a lot more.
1231	0	"We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up."
1232	0	"You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first."
1233	0	"I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country."
1234	0	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
1235	0	We've been at this a couple of years.
1236	0	But were mistakes made?
1237	0	"Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made."
1238	0	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
1239	0	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
1240	0	But what...
1241	0	Senator Sanders.
1242	0	"Look, the secretary is right."
1243	0	This is a terribly complicated issue.
1244	0	There are no simple solutions.
1245	0	"But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad."
1246	0	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
1247	0	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
1248	0	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
1249	0	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
1250	0	"Well, I would just repeat that."
1251	0	Secretary Clinton.
1252	0	Wait a minute.
1253	0	"I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote."
1254	0	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
1255	0	"Now, I understand that this is very difficult."
1256	0	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
1257	0	We saw what happened in Egypt.
1258	0	"I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship."
1259	0	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
1260	0	"One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy."
1261	0	That's a hard road to walk.
1262	0	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
1263	0	And Martha...
1264	0	Quick Governor O'Malley.
1265	0	"... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region."
1266	0	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
1267	0	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
1268	0	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
1269	0	"But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that."
1270	0	"And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL."
1271	0	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
1272	0	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
1273	0	Thank you very much.
1274	0	Thank you.
1275	0	We're going to move on here.
1276	0	"Governor O'Malley, thank you very much for that."
1277	0	And we're going to make a very sharp turn as we wrap things up here.
1278	0	"Secretary Clinton, first ladies, as you well know, have used their position to work on important causes like literacy and drug abuse."
1279	0	"But they also supervise the menus, the flowers, the holiday ornaments and White House decor."
1280	0	I know you think you know where I'm going here.
1281	0	You have said that Bill Clinton is a great host and loves giving tours but may opt out of picking flower arrangements if you're elected.
1282	0	"Bill Clinton aside, is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?"
1283	0	"Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it."
1284	0	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
1285	0	"Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise."
1286	0	And I think has had a big impact.
1287	0	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
1288	0	"And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that."
1289	0	"But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about."
1290	0	(APPLAUSE)
1291	0	Democrats discuss presidential spouses.
1292	0	"Candidates Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders talk about the roles their spouses would play in helping run the Oval Office (ABC News)."
1293	0	I do want to follow up here for each of you.
1294	0	And a similar line of questioning.
1295	0	"Senator Sanders, your wife Jane shares an office at your campaign headquarters in Burlington."
1296	0	"We've seen the pictures, the desks right next to each other."
1297	0	Would she have a desk close by in the west wing?
1298	0	"Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would."
1299	0	(LAUGHTER)
1300	0	"And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be."
1301	0	"So, I thank you very much for that."
1302	0	(LAUGHTER)
1303	0	"My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent."
1304	0	"Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed."
1305	0	And she turned around many lives.
1306	0	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
1307	0	"She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper."
1308	0	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
1309	0	She led that effort.
1310	0	"So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals."
1311	0	"Senator, thank you."
1312	0	"Well, that would be totally up to her."
1313	0	"I mean, Katie has never been a person who let her husband's professional choices get in the way of following her dreams."
1314	0	"And I think she got that from her mother, actually."
1315	0	(APPLAUSE)
1316	0	"The -- and I readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become, before I took my detour."
1317	0	She is a district court judge in Maryland.
1318	0	She puts in a full day there.
1319	0	We've raised four terrific kids.
1320	0	"And yet, when she was first lady of the state, not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut-wrenching cases, but then she'd put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence."
1321	0	"Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy, and her understanding of how the court process works."
1322	0	She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things.
1323	0	"So Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do, regardless of her husband's success in getting elected president."
1324	0	(APPLAUSE)
1325	0	"Governor O'Malley, thank you, (inaudible)."
1326	0	Thank you.
1327	0	"Governor, thank you."
1328	0	We'll be back with much more from New Hampshire.
1329	0	The Democratic debate continues right after this.
1330	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1331	0	Welcome back tonight.
1332	0	It's been an evening of lively discussion among the candidates and it's time for closing statements.
1333	0	"We began in alphabetical order, so we'll reverse the order at the end and begin with you, Senator Sanders."
1334	0	"Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here."
1335	0	"Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists."
1336	0	(APPLAUSE)
1337	0	"My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant."
1338	0	"We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York."
1339	0	"My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own."
1340	0	She never lived to see that.
1341	0	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
1342	0	We were the first in the family.
1343	0	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
1344	0	"And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."
1345	0	Thank you very much.
1346	0	(APPLAUSE)
1347	0	Governor O'Malley?
1348	0	"Martha, thank you."
1349	0	I want to thank all of the people who have tuned in tonight.
1350	0	"I want to thank the great people of New Hampshire, where despite all of the cynicism about big money and big banks taking over our politics, here in New Hampshire, the individual matters."
1351	0	"You know, my wife Katie and I have four terrific kids, and like you, there's probably nothing we wouldn't do to give them a future that's safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us."
1352	0	"Tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country."
1353	0	"When you listened to the Republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear."
1354	0	"Well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built America."
1355	0	"We build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all."
1356	0	"We do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again."
1357	0	"And we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or Republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat."
1358	0	The other big challenge we have is climate change.
1359	0	The greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years.
1360	0	We need to embrace this.
1361	0	"I have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050."
1362	0	Join this campaign for the future.
1363	0	New leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times.
1364	0	Thank you.
1365	0	"Governor, thank you."
1366	0	(APPLAUSE)
1367	0	Secretary Clinton?
1368	0	"On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House."
1369	0	"If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen."
1370	0	"A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk."
1371	0	"Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization."
1372	0	Our vets may see the V.A.
1373	0	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
1374	0	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
1375	0	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
1376	0	"You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that."
1377	0	This is a watershed election.
1378	0	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
1379	0	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
1380	0	"You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future."
1381	0	"But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential."
1382	0	"If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission."
1383	0	"Thank you, good night and may the force be with you."
1384	0	(APPLAUSE)
1385	0	Thank you to the candidates tonight.
1386	0	Thank you to the audience here in New Hampshire here at St. Anselm.
1387	0	And thank you to the audience at home.
1388	0	We wish all of you at home a happy and safe holiday week ahead and we wish all the candidates a happy and safe holiday with your families.
1	0	So let's get started.
2	0	"Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let's address the elephant not in the room tonight."
3	0	(LAUGHTER)
4	0	Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate.
5	0	What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?
6	0	"Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year."
7	0	"By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa."
8	0	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
9	0	"You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes."
10	0	"And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process."
11	0	"If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country."
12	0	It will be fly-to country.
13	0	(APPLAUSE)
14	0	"Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly."
15	0	"And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon."
16	0	(LAUGHTER)
17	0	Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
18	0	(LAUGHTER)
19	0	(APPLAUSE)
20	0	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
21	0	(APPLAUSE)
22	0	The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country.
23	0	"And for six months that -- your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel."
24	0	You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.
25	0	"But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding."
26	0	Which is it?
27	0	"Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate."
28	0	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
29	0	I am glad Donald is running.
30	0	"I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support."
31	0	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
32	0	"Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance."
33	0	"I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics."
34	0	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
35	0	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
36	0	(APPLAUSE)
37	0	"Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue."
38	0	"The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle."
39	0	You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP.
40	0	How?
41	0	"Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about."
42	0	It's not about Donald Trump.
43	0	He's an entertaining guy.
44	0	He's the greatest show on earth.
45	0	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
46	0	"You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America."
47	0	Barack Obama wants to change America.
48	0	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
49	0	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
50	0	We want to be the United States of America.
51	0	(APPLAUSE)
52	0	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
53	0	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
54	0	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
55	0	I don't think so.
56	0	"If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama."
57	0	(APPLAUSE)
58	0	"Governor Bush, it's hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment."
59	0	"But isn't that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?"
60	0	"Bret, we're just starting."
61	0	The first vote hasn't been counted.
62	0	Why don't we let the process work.
63	0	"I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out."
64	0	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
65	0	He was a little teddy bear to me.
66	0	(LAUGHTER)
67	0	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
68	0	I kind of miss him.
69	0	I wish he was here.
70	0	"Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability."
71	0	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
72	0	"Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president."
73	0	"Fine, I'll take it."
74	0	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
75	0	"I'll take that, too."
76	0	(APPLAUSE)
77	0	"But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting."
78	0	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
79	0	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
80	0	"Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent."
81	0	I released 34 years of tax returns...
82	0	(BELL RINGS)
83	0	"... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record."
84	0	"To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI."
85	0	(APPLAUSE)
86	0	Thank you governor.
87	0	"Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle."
88	0	"However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done."
89	0	And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise.
90	0	Why are they wrong and you're right?
91	0	They're not wrong.
92	0	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
93	0	You can do both.
94	0	"There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government."
95	0	"You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them."
96	0	"You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet."
97	0	"He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration."
98	0	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
99	0	And who's compromised and who is principled.
100	0	What he wants is something to get done.
101	0	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
102	0	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
103	0	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
104	0	"I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done."
105	0	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
106	0	(APPLAUSE)
107	0	"Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category."
108	0	"But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul."
109	0	Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement.
110	0	And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.
111	0	So did you make a mistake by not fully -- more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?
112	0	"You know, I've always had a great deal of respect."
113	0	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
114	0	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
115	0	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
116	0	"I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted."
117	0	"You know, Ted didn't show up."
118	0	"We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up."
119	0	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
120	0	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
121	0	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
122	0	The NSA is another big issue.
123	0	"Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records."
124	0	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
125	0	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
126	0	But we don't see it happening at all.
127	0	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
128	0	(APPLAUSE)
129	0	"Senator Cruz, your response to that?"
130	0	"Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition."
131	0	"You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority."
132	0	"When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it."
133	0	It didn't have the votes to pass.
134	0	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
135	0	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
136	0	(APPLAUSE)
137	0	Senator Rubio?
138	0	"I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand."
139	0	He believes everything he stands for.
140	0	(APPLAUSE)
141	0	I do respect Rand.
142	0	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
143	0	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
144	0	"And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS."
145	0	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
146	0	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
147	0	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
148	0	"And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe."
149	0	(APPLAUSE)
150	0	"Thank you, Senator."
151	0	May I respond?
152	0	(CROSSTALK)
153	0	We'll come back to...
154	0	"Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question."
155	0	"OK. Go ahead, go ahead."
156	0	"Just very quickly, I would like to respond."
157	0	"The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack."
158	0	I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.
159	0	"When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this."
160	0	Even the court declared it to be illegal.
161	0	"If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way."
162	0	Let's use the Fourth Amendment.
163	0	"Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it."
164	0	Let's respect the history of our country.
165	0	John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants.
166	0	Let's don't forget that.
167	0	(APPLAUSE)
168	0	"Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year."
169	0	"You call yourself a, quote, ""inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,"" but you reject the establishment label."
170	0	First question is why do you reject it?
171	0	"And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?"
172	0	"Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes."
173	0	"There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane."
174	0	"And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do."
175	1	"And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor."
176	0	"You know, the situation is this."
177	0	"We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party."
178	0	We have to come together as a country.
179	0	And we have to stop all the divisions.
180	0	"And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire."
181	0	"And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment."
182	0	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
183	0	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
184	0	"I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me."
185	0	(APPLAUSE)
186	0	"Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you."
187	0	Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane.
188	0	You've landed a lot of planes in the O.R.
189	0	But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?
190	0	"Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title."
191	0	"You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth."
192	0	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
193	0	"In fact, sometimes it's not that way..."
194	0	(APPLAUSE)
195	0	"... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before."
196	0	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
197	0	"We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem."
198	0	The American people are terrified.
199	0	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
200	0	We don't need more of the same solutions.
201	0	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
202	0	(APPLAUSE)
203	0	"Gentlemen, we're now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters' minds."
204	0	"I'm going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror."
205	0	"According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year."
206	0	"Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism."
207	0	You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion.
208	0	You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night.
209	0	But critics say that your record does not match up to that.
210	0	You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria.
211	0	"Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act."
212	0	"How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?"
213	0	"Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS."
214	0	(APPLAUSE)
215	0	"You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing."
216	0	It is not tough talk.
217	0	"It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama."
218	0	"Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military."
219	0	"You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war."
220	0	"When that war began, we had 8,000 planes."
221	0	"Today, we have about 4,000."
222	0	"When that war began, we had 529 ships."
223	0	"Today, we have 272."
224	0	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
225	0	"It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy."
226	0	"Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day."
227	0	He's not arming the Kurds.
228	0	We need to define the enemy.
229	0	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
230	0	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
231	0	(APPLAUSE)
232	0	"Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz's record match his rhetoric?"
233	0	"Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending."
234	0	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
235	0	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
236	0	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
237	0	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
238	0	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
239	0	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
240	0	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
241	0	They are not going to go away on their own.
242	0	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
243	0	"They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force."
244	0	"Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history."
245	0	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
246	0	"When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world."
247	0	(CROSSTALK)
248	0	"Senator Cruz, you've got 30 seconds."
249	0	You were mentioned.
250	0	(APPLAUSE)
251	0	"Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama."
252	0	"Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then."
253	0	"What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system."
254	0	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
255	0	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
256	0	Gentlemen.
257	0	"... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe."
258	0	My budget was mentioned.
259	0	My budget was mentioned.
260	0	"May I -- may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break."
261	0	"But first, you can join tonight's conversation right from home."
262	0	Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate to vote on which candidate you think has the best plan to defeat ISIS.
263	0	We'll be right back.
264	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
265	0	Welcome back.
266	0	Let's get right back to the questions.
267	0	Chris.
268	0	Thank you.
269	0	"Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President."
270	0	You've also said that Senator Cruz's vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe.
271	0	Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?
272	0	"Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe."
273	0	"Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about."
274	0	"I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do."
275	0	They like to ask direct questions.
276	0	"And, they asked about her email situation."
277	0	"And, here's what she said to the American people."
278	0	She did it for convenience.
279	0	For her convenience.
280	0	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
281	0	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
282	0	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
283	0	"Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris."
284	0	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
285	0	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
286	0	(CHEERING)
287	0	"The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on..."
288	0	(BELL RINGING)
289	0	"... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do."
290	0	(APPLAUSE)
291	0	Governor Bush...
292	0	Chris?
293	0	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
294	0	"No, you weren't."
295	0	"Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted."
296	0	"... Actually, I was..."
297	0	"... Chris, keep it coming..."
298	0	I don't think that your name was mentioned...
299	0	"... Chris, your questions that you..."
300	0	"... Sir, I think -- I think the question was..."
301	0	... What was your question...
302	0	"It's not my question that you get a chance to respond to, it's his answer."
303	0	(LAUGHTER)
304	0	You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me...
305	0	Your question was you have disagreed...
306	0	(AUDIENCE REACTION)
307	0	... You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me...
308	0	... (inaudible) opening statement.
309	0	If I could go on.
310	0	"Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we're going to conduct a debate..."
311	0	Thank you Chris...
312	0	Governor Bush...
313	0	"This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)"
314	0	"Governor Bush, here's the question -- I'm going to ask Governor Bush the question."
315	0	"You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria."
316	0	"But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended."
317	0	"That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?"
318	0	"Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force."
319	0	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
320	0	"We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time."
321	0	"It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino."
322	0	Now we hear the tough talk.
323	0	"Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan."
324	0	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
325	0	"And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country."
326	0	"The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders."
327	0	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
328	0	(CHEERING)
329	0	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
330	0	"But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support..."
331	0	(BELL RINGING)
332	0	... ground and air.
333	0	"That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign."
334	0	(APPLAUSE)
335	0	"Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond."
336	0	"Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, ""Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted..."""
337	0	(AUDIENCE)
338	0	Let me just say this...
339	0	"It is a debate, sir."
340	0	"... Well, no, no."
341	0	"A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this."
342	0	"Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage."
343	0	(APPLAUSE)
344	0	"Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief."
345	0	"Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe."
346	0	"That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other."
347	0	I think the questions were about issues.
348	0	"Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir..."
349	0	(APPLAUSE)
350	0	(CROSSTALK)
351	0	"Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond..."
352	0	"... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after."
353	0	(LAUGHTER)
354	0	First of all...
355	0	(LAUGHTER)
356	0	First of all...
357	0	... and I'd like to respond.
358	0	"... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after."
359	0	But...
360	0	(LAUGHTER)
361	0	... first of all...
362	0	Thank you.
363	0	"Thank you, Marco."
364	0	"... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me."
365	0	Good.
366	0	And second of all...
367	0	(APPLAUSE)
368	0	"... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS."
369	0	It was against Assad.
370	0	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
371	0	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
372	0	"So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad."
373	0	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
374	0	(BELL RINGS)
375	0	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
376	0	"When I'm president, that will change."
377	0	(CROSSTALK)
378	0	"Senator Paul, go ahead."
379	0	Thank you.
380	0	"The issue in Syria's a very important one, and it's one we need to get right."
381	0	"The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war?"
382	0	Some want (ph) to topple Assad.
383	0	"In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously."
384	0	"I think that's a really, really bad idea."
385	0	"In fact, I've said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS."
386	0	"But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space."
387	0	You might -- you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.
388	0	(BELL RINGS)
389	0	Chris...
390	0	(APPLAUSE)
391	0	"... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience."
392	0	"And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this."
393	0	I think they'd want to hear it.
394	0	"Look, I served on..."
395	0	Well...
396	0	(CROSSTALK)
397	0	... we'll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later.
398	0	We're going to talk...
399	0	We have a lot -- we have a lot to cover.
400	0	But we want to -- we want to turn the page to domestic...
401	0	(CROSSTALK)
402	0	... but wait a minute...
403	0	"No, no."
404	0	No.
405	0	...the only reason is -- look...
406	0	"No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why we're partnering with Google on this debate, and they're telling us..."
407	0	OK.
408	0	... that their search results have gone through the roof on -- on people...
409	0	"I've always listened to you, Megyn."
410	0	Go ahead.
411	0	"... you're a good man, Governor Kasich."
412	0	Yes -- thank you.
413	0	"People -- the search results -- the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008."
414	0	People are worried.
415	0	"They're worried about what's happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know."
416	0	"Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you've advocated closing down mosques -- we'll get back to you."
417	0	"Well, you have advocated closing down -- closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring."
418	0	You told me that.
419	0	But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.
420	0	"In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror."
421	0	Doesn't your position run afoul of the First Amendment?
422	0	"Megyn, that's the problem."
423	0	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
424	0	It's hate action.
425	0	They blow people up.
426	0	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
427	1	"Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times."
428	1	"He told the police, ""I did it because I was inspired by ISIS,"" and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror."
429	0	"Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented."
430	0	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
431	0	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
432	0	"They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world."
433	0	We must keep America safe from this threat.
434	0	"And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo."
435	0	(APPLAUSE)
436	0	(inaudible).
437	0	"Senator Paul, do you agree with that?"
438	0	"We're gonna close down mosques, we're gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking's (ph) occurring?"
439	0	(CROSSTALK)
440	0	"Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques."
441	0	"But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security."
442	0	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
443	0	"When he brought forward the ""Gang of Eight"" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us."
444	0	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
445	0	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
446	0	"And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways."
447	0	You can't be in favor of defend us...
448	0	(BELL RINGS)
449	0	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
450	0	Might I respond?
451	0	(APPLAUSE)
452	0	"The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton."
453	0	I think we all support that.
454	0	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
455	0	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
456	0	"And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented..."
457	0	(BELL RINGS)
458	0	"... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America."
459	0	"Governor Christie, let's talk about profiling."
460	0	(APPLAUSE)
461	0	In December...
462	0	Talk about what?
463	0	I...
464	0	... profiling.
465	0	Profiling.
466	0	"In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California."
467	0	"Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling."
468	0	"Now, you have said that we should not profile."
469	0	How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?
470	0	"Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts."
471	0	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
472	0	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
473	0	"That's not profiling, that's law enforcement."
474	0	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
475	0	They didn't know they were going to attack the country.
476	0	"They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn."
477	0	They knew that.
478	0	(CROSSTALK)
479	0	That's not true.
480	0	The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage.
481	0	They saw packages being delivered.
482	0	"They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops."
483	0	Do you?
484	0	"Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense."
485	0	"And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions."
486	0	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
487	0	"It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not."
488	0	"You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions."
489	0	That's what should be done.
490	0	That can be done.
491	0	That can be done without profiling people.
492	0	"What that is, is just common sense."
493	0	They thought something was wrong.
494	0	And here's the problem in this country right now.
495	0	"The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy."
496	0	"They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer."
497	0	It's making...
498	0	(BELL RINGS)
499	0	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
500	0	(BELL RINGS)
501	0	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
502	0	"As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community."
503	0	(APPLAUSE)
504	0	"Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children."
505	0	Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country.
506	0	"Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?"
507	0	"Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging."
508	0	"You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't."
509	0	(APPLAUSE)
510	0	"And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them."
511	0	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
512	0	"Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants."
513	0	"As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans."
514	0	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
515	0	"If not, they can stay where they are."
516	0	(APPLAUSE)
517	0	"Governor Kasich, stand back."
518	0	"You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking."
519	0	And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.
520	0	"Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too."
521	0	And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans.
522	0	Are they wrong?
523	0	"Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools."
524	0	"And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement."
525	0	"And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks."
526	0	But this is public testimony.
527	0	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
528	0	Now I want to go back something.
529	0	"See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military."
530	0	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
531	0	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
532	0	"We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America."
533	0	"We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground."
534	0	"It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War."
535	0	"And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave."
536	0	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
537	0	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
538	0	"But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks."
539	0	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
540	0	"I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it."
541	0	"And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience."
542	0	"At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform."
543	0	"All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world."
544	0	"Governor, thank you."
545	0	(APPLAUSE)
546	0	"Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences."
547	0	So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.
548	0	If you were president.
549	0	would you police these charity organizations that say they're helping vets?
550	0	Of course.
551	0	"And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that."
552	0	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
553	0	That's his first responsibility.
554	0	(APPLAUSE)
555	0	"Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military."
556	0	"More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows."
557	0	"They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care."
558	0	"People died, and only three people have been fired."
559	0	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
560	0	"You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result."
561	0	"And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example."
562	0	"In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston."
563	0	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
564	0	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
565	0	"Governor Bush, thank you."
566	0	(APPLAUSE)
567	0	"Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators."
568	0	"Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtube's most followed stars."
569	0	And here's one of them.
570	0	I'm Mark Watson.
571	0	"I'm known for my (inaudible) views on Youtube, but I'm also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years."
572	0	"As an African-American living near Ferguson, I've seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand."
573	0	"Now, there are great tools like body cameras that -- to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts."
574	0	Why aren't we using the technology available to better protect our communities?
575	0	"Senator Paul, that question to you."
576	0	"You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras."
577	0	"I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem."
578	0	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
579	0	People were just being fined to death.
580	0	"Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it."
581	0	"If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job."
582	0	"I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males."
583	0	"In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men."
584	0	"Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown."
585	0	I think something has to change.
586	0	"I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform."
587	0	(APPLAUSE)
588	0	"Senator Paul, thank you."
589	0	This debate is just getting started.
590	0	"Coming up, the role of the federal government."
591	0	"But first, join tonight's conversation right from your home."
592	0	Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News Debate to vote on which issue is most important to you in this election.
593	0	More from the Iowa Events Center and the Republican presidential debate in a moment.
594	0	(APPLAUSE)
595	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
596	0	"Welcome back, everybody."
597	0	"We are live in Des Moines, Iowa."
598	0	And let's get right back to the questions -- Bret.
599	0	"Thank you, Megyn."
600	0	"Gentlemen, I'll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government."
601	0	"Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they'll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn't ever materialize."
602	0	We all know that.
603	0	"Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget."
604	0	But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?
605	0	Yes.
606	0	You want one?
607	0	(LAUGHTER)
608	0	I want one.
609	0	Yes.
610	0	(LAUGHTER)
611	0	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
612	0	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
613	0	(APPLAUSE)
614	0	Anything bigger than that?
615	0	Bigger than that?
616	0	"Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that."
617	0	(APPLAUSE)
618	0	"And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you're not alone."
619	0	"Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched ""policy repeals,"" that there were a lot of them."
620	0	Obamacare took the top two spots.
621	0	But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.
622	0	"So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance?"
623	0	And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?
624	0	Sure.
625	0	"Well, let's take it one at a time."
626	1	"First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster."
627	1	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
628	1	"Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket."
629	0	"If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare."
630	0	(APPLAUSE)
631	0	"Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform."
632	0	"It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors."
633	0	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
634	0	"Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines."
635	0	"That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance."
636	0	"Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs."
637	0	"And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable."
638	1	"And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt."
639	0	(APPLAUSE)
640	0	"Senator Cruz, thank you."
641	0	"Governor Bush, you've advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico."
642	0	The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden.
643	0	Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed.
644	0	"So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?"
645	0	"No, they shouldn't."
646	0	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
647	0	"If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship."
648	0	They serve in the military.
649	0	They would have to pay federal taxes.
650	0	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
651	0	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
652	0	"Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face."
653	0	"You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando."
654	0	And a lot of people are doing that.
655	0	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
656	0	"The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now."
657	0	"Governor Kasich, you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race."
658	0	"Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire -- he and his administration -- for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it."
659	0	How would you have handled that?
660	0	"Well, you've got to be on top of it right away."
661	0	"And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done."
662	0	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
663	0	"But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that."
664	0	"And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting."
665	0	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
666	0	You've got to be on top of it.
667	0	You've got to go the extra mile.
668	0	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
669	0	Because you realize that people depending on you.
670	0	"And so, you go the extra mile."
671	0	But people have to be alert.
672	0	They have to be alert to problems.
673	0	"And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it."
674	0	"And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them."
675	0	"Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct."
676	0	So the fact is that we work for the people.
677	0	The people don't work for us.
678	0	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
679	0	That's what really matters.
680	0	We serve you.
681	0	You don't serve us.
682	0	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
683	0	(APPLAUSE)
684	0	"Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy."
685	0	"Now, you're a skeptic of climate change science."
686	0	"And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy."
687	0	So why the change?
688	0	"Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story."
689	0	"At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida."
690	0	And I opposed it.
691	0	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
692	0	"And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it."
693	0	"And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it."
694	0	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
695	0	And I was clear about that at the time.
696	0	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
697	0	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
698	0	"And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy."
699	0	"When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States."
700	0	(APPLAUSE)
701	0	"Thanks, Senator."
702	0	All right.
703	0	We're going to move on.
704	0	"Because coming up, immigration, and something you've never seen before."
705	0	"Stay tuned, right after this break."
706	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
707	0	Welcome back everyone.
708	0	"Live, in Des Moines, Iowa."
709	0	"Now, we move onto the topic of immigration."
710	0	"Senator Rubio, we'll start with you."
711	0	"When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants."
712	0	You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S.
713	0	Senator as well.
714	0	Here are just a few examples.
715	0	Watch.
716	0	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
717	0	Never support.
718	0	"Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally."
719	0	(END VIDEO CLIP)
720	0	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
721	0	"First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty."
722	0	It's what they call it.
723	0	"And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so."
724	0	(END VIDEO CLIP)
725	0	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
726	0	You cannot grant amnesty.
727	0	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
728	0	"They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future."
729	0	(END VIDEO CLIP)
730	1	"Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty."
731	0	Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?
732	0	"No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific."
733	1	"And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty..."
734	0	"But, you went on from there..."
735	1	I do not support amnesty...
736	0	"... You said more than that, Senator..."
737	1	"... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty..."
738	1	... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
739	0	You...
740	0	It was...
741	0	... supported earned path to citizenship...
742	1	"It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate."
743	0	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
744	0	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
745	0	"They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens."
746	0	"And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president."
747	0	"Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America."
748	0	"If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States."
749	0	"Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws."
750	0	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
751	0	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
752	0	"We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents."
753	0	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
754	0	"We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen."
755	0	"We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either."
756	0	There will be a process.
757	0	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
758	0	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
759	0	"Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?"
760	0	"Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time."
761	0	"I mean, that's a fact."
762	0	And he asked me to support that.
763	0	"And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things."
764	0	"And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years."
765	0	"And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess."
766	0	Here's what I believe.
767	0	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
768	0	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
769	0	It's not a bestseller.
770	0	I can promise you.
771	0	(LAUGHTER)
772	0	There won't be any -- you can get it.
773	0	It's affordable for everybody.
774	0	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
775	0	"It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English."
776	0	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
777	0	(APPLAUSE)
778	0	I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
779	0	May I respond?
780	0	"Go ahead, senator."
781	0	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
782	0	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
783	0	So did you.
784	0	(LAUGHTER)
785	0	"Well, but you changed the -- in the book..."
786	0	Yeah.
787	0	"So did you, Marco."
788	0	(APPLAUSE)
789	0	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
790	0	"And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control."
791	0	"The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens."
792	0	"It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control."
793	0	"And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it."
794	0	"Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name."
795	0	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
796	0	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
797	0	A bipartisan approach got close.
798	0	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
799	0	"And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to."
800	0	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
801	0	There's never going do be perfect bill.
802	0	(APPLAUSE)
803	0	All right.
804	0	"But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run."
805	0	But Megyn...
806	0	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
807	0	He cut and run.
808	0	And that's a tragedy because now...
809	0	(BELL RINGS)
810	0	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
811	0	All right.
812	0	This will be the last one.
813	0	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
814	0	That is abundantly clear.
815	0	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
816	0	"The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control."
817	0	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
818	0	OK. Let's move on.
819	0	"Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment."
820	0	It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship.
821	0	"Yes, it would."
822	0	"Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn't."
823	0	Right?
824	0	Like you just did.
825	0	Saw that.
826	0	(LAUGHTER)
827	0	"You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it's something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through."
828	0	"But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time."
829	0	Watch.
830	0	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
831	0	I want this bill to be voted down.
832	0	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
833	0	I want immigration reform to pass.
834	0	"I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically."
835	0	"I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass."
836	0	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
837	0	"If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground."
838	0	"That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table."
839	0	Was that all an act?
840	0	It was pretty convincing.
841	0	"You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words."
842	0	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
843	1	"In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship."
844	1	It didn't say a word about legalization.
845	0	I introduced...
846	1	But the bill allowed both.
847	1	The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.
848	0	"But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages."
849	0	"I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill."
850	0	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
851	0	"And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress."
852	0	"And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes."
853	0	"Listen, we can solve immigration."
854	0	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
855	0	"I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org."
856	0	"It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and..."
857	0	(APPLAUSE)
858	0	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
859	0	We can build the fence.
860	0	We can triple the border patrol.
861	0	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
862	0	(BELL RINGS)
863	0	... funding to them.
864	0	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
865	0	"And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem."
866	0	If I am elected president...
867	0	(BELL RINGS)
868	0	... we will secure the border...
869	0	"OK, sir."
870	0	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
871	0	Senator Paul.
872	0	(APPLAUSE)
873	0	You know how Washington works.
874	0	Do you buy that?
875	0	I was there and I saw the debate.
876	0	"I saw Ted Cruz say, ""we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."""
877	0	The bill would involve legalization.
878	0	He can't have it both ways.
879	0	"But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, ""you're for amnesty."""
880	0	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
881	0	"But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty."
882	0	I was for legalization.
883	0	"I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization."
884	0	"So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so."
885	0	That's not true.
886	0	"Go ahead, sir."
887	0	(APPLAUSE)
888	0	"You know, John Adams famously said, ""facts are are stubborn things."""
889	0	"The facts are are very, very simple."
890	0	"When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty."
891	0	"And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty."
892	0	"And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, ""if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed""."
893	0	"But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it."
894	0	(BELL RINGS)
895	0	(APPLAUSE)
896	0	"Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill..."
897	0	"Yeah, but let me respond..."
898	0	... agrees with Ted Cruz on this.
899	0	"... no, I understand, but let me respond."
900	0	"I (ph) was mentioned on this -- in this answer, and so I'm going to respond this way."
901	0	"This is the lie that Ted's campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it -- that he's the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a -- you know, everyone else is a rhino."
902	0	"The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you've been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes."
903	0	"Ted, you worked for George W. Bush's campaign..."
904	0	(BOOING)
905	0	You -- you -- you helped design George W. Bush's -- you helped design George W. Bush's immigration policy.
906	0	"And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News -- I (ph) wasn't even part of the video -- where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, ""we can reach a compromise."""
907	0	"And then in the committee, you said, ""I want to bring people out of the shadows."""
908	0	(BELL RINGS)
909	0	Now you want to trump Trump on immigration.
910	0	But you can't -- we're not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone who's willing to say or do anything to win an election.
911	0	"Go ahead, Senator Cruz."
912	0	(APPLAUSE)
913	0	"You know, I like Marco."
914	0	He's very charming.
915	0	He's very smooth.
916	0	But the facts are simple.
917	0	"When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, ""if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."""
918	0	"When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, ""if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."""
919	0	We both made the identical promises.
920	0	"But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice."
921	0	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
922	0	(BELL RINGS)
923	0	"I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country."
924	0	(APPLAUSE)
925	0	All right.
926	0	Megyn?
927	0	"Go ahead, Governor Christie."
928	0	I want to ask the people of the audience.
929	0	"Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz."
930	0	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
931	0	I heard what they said.
932	0	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
933	0	(APPLAUSE)
934	0	I feel like...
935	0	(APPLAUSE)
936	0	"I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?"
937	0	(LAUGHTER)
938	0	"I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video."
939	0	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
940	0	You can change your mind.
941	0	Ted can change his mind.
942	0	Marco can change his mind.
943	0	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
944	0	"But when you're a governor, you have to admit it."
945	0	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
946	0	"That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House."
947	0	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
948	0	(APPLAUSE)
949	0	Let's go to a Youtube question.
950	0	Let's get to a Youtube question.
951	0	This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers.
952	0	Watch.
953	0	"I'm Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl."
954	0	"Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur."
955	0	"There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country."
956	0	"If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?"
957	0	"Dr. Carson, that's one -- that one's for you."
958	0	"Oh, great."
959	0	(LAUGHTER)
960	0	"As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us."
961	0	"Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough."
962	0	"If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out."
963	0	"You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe."
964	0	(APPLAUSE)
965	0	Can I -- can I -- I just...
966	0	Go ahead.
967	0	"That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur."
968	0	(APPLAUSE)
969	0	And we should be a welcoming nation.
970	0	"Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values."
971	0	That's American citizenship.
972	0	"And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives."
973	0	That's what we believe in.
974	0	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
975	0	And I think that's the false choice...
976	0	(APPLAUSE)
977	0	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
978	0	"Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants."
979	0	"By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is."
980	0	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
981	0	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
982	0	"I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?"
983	0	And that's not what's happening now.
984	0	(APPLAUSE)
985	0	All right.
986	0	"I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here."
987	0	"In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization."
988	0	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
989	0	All right.
990	0	We're moving on.
991	0	(APPLAUSE)
992	0	"Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you're either facing in the primaries or issues that you're certainly going to face in a general election."
993	0	So you may not be altogether unhappy if you're not included in this round.
994	0	(LAUGHTER)
995	0	"Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we've seen to a certain degree tonight, there's a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel."
996	0	"Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you."
997	0	"You -- twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it."
998	0	"Top GOP officials worry that if you're at the top of the ticket -- some officials -- that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line."
999	0	"The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?"
1000	0	"Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington."
1001	0	(APPLAUSE)
1002	0	"And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign."
1003	0	"The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign."
1004	0	"The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org."
1005	0	"This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along."
1006	0	Washington is broken.
1007	0	"And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do."
1008	0	(APPLAUSE)
1009	0	Thank you.
1010	0	"Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton."
1011	0	Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.
1012	0	"Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio."
1013	0	Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?
1014	0	"Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly."
1015	0	"And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth."
1016	0	"That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment."
1017	0	"So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her."
1018	0	"As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that."
1019	0	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
1020	0	"The simple fact is, we all have a record."
1021	0	It all will be scrutinized.
1022	0	There's give and take.
1023	0	It's called the politics.
1024	0	And that's the way it is.
1025	0	"I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States."
1026	0	(APPLAUSE)
1027	0	"Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?"
1028	0	"Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton."
1029	0	"Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her."
1030	0	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
1031	1	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
1032	0	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
1033	0	That would be a disaster for this country.
1034	0	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
1035	0	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
1036	0	"Now let's talk about electability, Senator."
1037	0	"TIME magazine once called you ""the Republican savior."""
1038	0	Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.
1039	0	"But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you're in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points."
1040	0	"If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?"
1041	0	"Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me."
1042	0	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
1043	0	(APPLAUSE)
1044	0	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
1045	0	"As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election."
1046	0	"You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?"
1047	0	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
1048	0	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
1049	0	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
1050	0	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
1051	0	(LAUGHTER)
1052	0	We don't want to be Sweden.
1053	0	We want to be the United States of America.
1054	0	(APPLAUSE)
1055	0	"And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States."
1056	0	"In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton..."
1057	0	(LAUGHTER)
1058	0	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
1059	0	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
1060	0	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
1061	0	(APPLAUSE)
1062	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1063	0	"Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the ""Bridge-gate"" case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge."
1064	0	"Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal."
1065	0	"Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?"
1066	0	"Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing."
1067	0	"And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible."
1068	0	And that's what you expect from a leader.
1069	0	"And, I'll tell you something else."
1070	0	"I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation."
1071	0	"And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years."
1072	0	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
1073	0	"And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?"
1074	0	"Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September."
1075	0	"And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am."
1076	0	I will be ready.
1077	0	"I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House."
1078	0	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
1079	0	(APPLAUSE)
1080	0	"Much more to come, including where the candidates stand on foreign policy."
1081	0	"And, once again, you can go to Google.com, or open your Google search app and search, ""Fox News Debate"" to vote on which candidate you think is winning the debate tonight."
1082	0	We'll be right back.
1083	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1084	0	"Welcome back, everybody."
1085	0	Let's get back to the questions.
1086	0	Chris?
1087	0	"Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I'd like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues."
1088	0	"Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith."
1089	0	"In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he's going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small."
1090	0	"Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you're getting in and he isn't?"
1091	0	(LAUGHTER)
1092	0	No.
1093	0	"You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state."
1094	0	"We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government."
1095	0	"And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home."
1096	0	"And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money."
1097	0	"It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill."
1098	0	Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
1099	0	How has it worked?
1100	1	"Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent."
1101	0	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
1102	0	The mentally ill?
1103	0	"They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them."
1104	0	"In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance."
1105	0	"But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do."
1106	0	But what -- I will tell you this.
1107	0	"The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted."
1108	0	(APPLAUSE)
1109	0	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
1110	0	Give people a chance.
1111	0	We talked about criminal justice reform.
1112	0	We've enacted it in our state.
1113	0	"Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America."
1114	0	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
1115	0	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
1116	0	We're running surpluses.
1117	0	"We're up 400,000 jobs."
1118	0	And guess what?
1119	0	The formula is working.
1120	0	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
1121	0	Thank you.
1122	0	(APPLAUSE)
1123	0	"Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer."
1124	0	"A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs."
1125	0	"Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience."
1126	0	But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.
1127	0	"No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed."
1128	0	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
1129	0	"So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky."
1130	0	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
1131	0	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
1132	0	"And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do."
1133	0	"But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said."
1134	0	"You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith."
1135	0	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
1136	0	"The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us."
1137	0	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
1138	0	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
1139	0	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
1140	0	"That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls."
1141	0	"As a Catholic, that's what I want to do."
1142	0	"And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do."
1143	0	(APPLAUSE)
1144	0	"Thank you, sir."
1145	0	"Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court."
1146	0	"He said you're wrong on the facts and you can't, quote, ""slime your way to the White House."""
1147	0	"I assume in the last two weeks, you've done some fact-checking."
1148	0	Do you want to take anything back?
1149	0	"Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves."
1150	0	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
1151	0	And I think this is an important question.
1152	0	"I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history."
1153	0	"You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?"
1154	0	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
1155	0	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
1156	0	"It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor."
1157	0	This is what's made our nation so special.
1158	0	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
1159	0	"Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures."
1160	0	"And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life."
1161	0	"Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator."
1162	0	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
1163	0	(APPLAUSE)
1164	0	"Thank you, senator."
1165	0	"Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn't get into politics to fight about abortion."
1166	0	You said you were more concerned about the national debt.
1167	0	Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.
1168	0	"Does that mean that if a liberal state, let's say, wants to make abortion legal, that you're okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?"
1169	0	"You know, I think abortion is always wrong."
1170	0	"I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal."
1171	0	"In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb."
1172	0	"But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people."
1173	0	"In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people."
1174	0	"Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint."
1175	0	There's a lot packed into that statement.
1176	0	"But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation."
1177	0	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
1178	0	"But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way."
1179	0	"I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction."
1180	0	"Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific..."
1181	0	(APPLAUSE)
1182	0	Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question.
1183	0	"Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states' rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that's their choice?"
1184	0	Yes or no?
1185	0	Both.
1186	0	"No, both the federal and a state approach."
1187	0	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
1188	0	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
1189	0	"But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states."
1190	0	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
1191	0	"If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again."
1192	0	"I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives."
1193	0	"Thank you, sir."
1194	0	(APPLAUSE)
1195	0	Gentlemen.
1196	0	(APPLAUSE)
1197	0	I'd like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.
1198	0	"Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine."
1199	0	"Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia."
1200	0	"Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all."
1201	0	What do you do?
1202	0	"Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down."
1203	0	"And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region."
1204	0	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
1205	0	We only have one or two.
1206	0	We need much more than that.
1207	0	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
1208	0	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
1209	0	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
1210	0	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country oil and energy.
1211	0	And we ought to fight them on that level.
1212	0	"We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained."
1213	0	"So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked."
1214	0	"I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies."
1215	0	(APPLAUSE)
1216	0	"Gentlemen, you've all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one."
1217	0	"Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who've said you would tear it up on day one."
1218	0	"But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars -- tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe."
1219	0	"The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal."
1220	0	"So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran."
1221	0	"So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?"
1222	0	"Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state."
1223	0	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
1224	0	"But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future."
1225	0	"He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet."
1226	0	"And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage."
1227	0	"That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon."
1228	0	"We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice."
1229	0	"They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy."
1230	0	"Governor Kasich, you've said that Marco Rubio is wrong..."
1231	0	(APPLAUSE)
1232	0	... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.
1233	0	"Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months."
1234	0	"And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions."
1235	0	"We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective."
1236	0	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
1237	0	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
1238	0	"You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on."
1239	0	We need to move aggressively now.
1240	0	"But I would say this to you, Bret."
1241	0	"Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them."
1242	0	"And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out."
1243	0	That is what we have to do.
1244	0	"We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea."
1245	0	"But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones."
1246	0	That's right.
1247	0	Yes.
1248	0	And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.
1249	0	"I know, Bret."
1250	0	They don't want...
1251	0	"But Bret, here's the problem."
1252	0	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
1253	0	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
1254	0	"I said, ""how's it going?"""
1255	0	"He said, ""we have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we'd ever see it."""
1256	0	"See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together."
1257	0	The Turks are being threatened.
1258	0	We know about the French.
1259	0	We know about the Belgians.
1260	0	We know about the Brits.
1261	0	"Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance."
1262	0	"So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together..."
1263	0	(BELL RINGS)
1264	0	... and say there is something more important than money.
1265	0	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
1266	0	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
1267	0	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
1268	0	"And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China."
1269	0	"Governor, thank you."
1270	0	Governor Christie...
1271	0	(APPLAUSE)
1272	0	... Libya is the newest base for ISIS.
1273	0	"Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities."
1274	0	"So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?"
1275	0	"Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief."
1276	0	"In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, ""what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"""
1277	0	"Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong."
1278	0	"If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it."
1279	0	Here's what I'd do.
1280	0	"This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS."
1281	0	"We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe."
1282	0	"As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do."
1283	0	"Thank you, Governor."
1284	0	(APPLAUSE)
1285	0	We're not finished yet.
1286	0	"More to come from the presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa, next."
1287	0	"And remember, to see how the campaigns are responding to the debate in real time, go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate, and please stay with us."
1288	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1289	0	(APPLAUSE)
1290	0	Welcome back to Des Moines.
1291	0	Let's resume the debate.
1292	0	Megyn?
1293	0	"Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton's history with women is fair game in this campaign."
1294	0	How do you answer those who say you don't hold the sins of the husband against the wife?
1295	0	"You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question."
1296	0	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
1297	0	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
1298	0	"But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired."
1299	0	They would never be hired again.
1300	0	(APPLAUSE)
1301	0	"Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community."
1302	0	"And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior."
1303	0	So it is difficult.
1304	0	Of her husband's?
1305	0	Yeah.
1306	0	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
1307	0	(APPLAUSE)
1308	0	We have another question from one of Youtube's top creators.
1309	0	Here it is.
1310	0	I'm Nabela Noor.
1311	0	I'm a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.
1312	0	"In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I've seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims."
1313	0	"This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence."
1314	0	"As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?"
1315	0	"Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?"
1316	0	"Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences."
1317	0	"Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him..."
1318	0	(LAUGHTER)
1319	0	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
1320	0	"Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country."
1321	0	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
1322	0	She wants to pursue the American dream.
1323	0	She's an American citizen.
1324	0	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
1325	0	She's not the threat.
1326	0	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
1327	0	"We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS."
1328	0	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
1329	0	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
1330	0	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
1331	0	"So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump."
1332	0	"Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength."
1333	0	Making fun of disabled people...
1334	0	(BELL RINGING)
1335	0	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
1336	0	(APPLAUSE)
1337	0	"Governor, thank you."
1338	0	"Senator Cruz, change of subject."
1339	0	"You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline."
1340	0	"As you well know, ethanol's a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year."
1341	0	"Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa..."

1343	0	"... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you're bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you."
1344	0	"Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?"
1345	0	"Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy."
1346	0	"I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above."
1347	0	"We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels."
1348	0	"But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers."
1349	0	"And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever."
1350	0	(APPLAUSE)
1351	0	"And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website."
1352	0	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
1353	0	"It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone."
1354	0	"Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol."
1355	0	It's not true.
1356	0	"I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone."
1357	0	"And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline."
1358	0	I will...
1359	0	(BELL RINGING)
1360	0	"Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates."
1361	0	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
1362	0	"And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign."
1363	0	"Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers."
1364	0	(APPLAUSE)
1365	0	"Dr. Carson, I'd like to ask you about exactly that issue."
1366	0	"Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question."
1367	0	"Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?"
1368	0	"Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?"
1369	0	"I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?"
1370	0	"We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations."
1371	0	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
1372	0	This is absolutely absurd.
1373	0	"And, they've insinuated themselves into everything."
1374	0	"Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money."
1375	0	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
1376	0	"But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy."
1377	0	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).
1378	0	What about hydroelectric power?
1379	0	"We can develop that, you know?"
1380	0	"We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs."
1381	0	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
1382	0	"And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments."
1383	0	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
1384	0	(APPLAUSE)

1399	0	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
1400	0	And it has been amazing to me.
1401	0	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
1402	0	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
1403	0	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
1404	0	Thank you.
1405	0	(APPLAUSE)
1406	0	Ohio Governor Kasich.
1407	0	"You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?"
1408	0	"Well, I've got news for you, we can."
1409	0	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
1410	0	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
1411	0	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
1412	0	We can re-assume our role in the world.
1413	0	"But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra."
1414	0	"You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist"
1415	0	(BELL RINGS)

33	0	Those lights will warn you when time is up.

36	0	"We know that each of you wants to debate these important issues, but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another."
37	0	These are the rules to which all of you agreed.
38	0	Our goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues.
39	0	It's time now for opening statements.
40	0	You'll each have 30 seconds.
41	0	"Governor Kasich, we will start with you."
42	0	"Well, thank you."
43	0	"You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful."
44	0	And many are hopeful.
45	0	"Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy."

47	0	And I believe it's a new partnership - a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.
48	0	Thank you.
49	0	(APPLAUSE)
50	0	Senator Rubio?
51	0	Every election is important.
52	0	I believe this is the most important election in a generation.
53	0	Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins.
54	0	What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.
55	0	"For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation."
56	0	And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way.
57	0	"If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived."
58	0	And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.
59	0	(APPLAUSE)
60	0	Senator Cruz?
61	0	"Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West."
62	0	He was 18.
63	0	"He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth."
64	0	"This election, this debate is not about insults."
65	0	It's not about attacks.
66	0	It's not about any of the individuals on this stage.
67	0	This election is about you and your children.
68	0	"It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America."
69	0	(APPLAUSE)
70	0	Mr. Trump?
71	0	One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party.
72	0	Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting.
73	0	They're voting out of enthusiasm.
74	0	They're voting out of love.
75	0	"Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before."
76	0	We're taking people from the Democrat Party.
77	0	"We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it."
78	0	It's very exciting.
79	0	"I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening."
80	0	We're having millions of extra people join.
81	0	We are going to beat the Democrats.
82	0	We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be.
83	0	And we're going to beat them soundly.
84	0	(APPLAUSE)
85	0	Thank you.
86	0	Thank you.
87	0	"Let's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election."
88	0	There have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers.
89	0	"One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America."
90	0	"Governor Kasich, I'd like to start with you."
91	0	You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years.
92	0	"Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs."
93	0	How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?
94	0	"Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family."
95	0	And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade.
96	0	One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.
97	0	"But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade."
98	0	"And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""Oh, America was right,"" and people are out of work."
99	0	The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process.
100	0	"When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle."
101	0	"And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker."
102	0	But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world.
103	0	"Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up."
104	0	People will buy less.
105	0	Other people will be out of work.
106	0	And we don't want to see that happen.
107	0	"Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up."
108	0	"And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar."
109	0	I understand their plight.
110	0	(APPLAUSE)
111	0	"Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico."
112	0	Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses?
113	0	Because nobody knows the system better than me.
114	0	I know the H1B.
115	0	I know the H2B.
116	0	Nobody knows it better than me.
117	0	I'm a businessman.
118	0	These are laws.
119	0	These are regulations.
120	0	These are rules.
121	0	We're allowed to do it.
122	0	"And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete."
123	0	So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws.
124	0	But I'm the one that knows how to change it.
125	0	"Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me."
126	0	"Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, ""generally very much in favor of free trade."""
127	0	"More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals."
128	0	"If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?"
129	0	"No, I support free trade deals that are good for America."
130	0	We're 5 percent of the world's population.
131	0	"If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth."
132	0	We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.
133	0	The problem is we're a low-tariff country.
134	0	"To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high."
135	0	And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.
136	0	There are good trade deals and there are bad ones.
137	0	"So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia."
138	0	It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry.
139	0	We have a surplus with Colombia.
140	0	"On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others."
141	0	"Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet."
142	0	"If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century."
143	0	(APPLAUSE)
144	0	"Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position."
145	0	Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?
146	0	Actually that's incorrect.
147	0	There are two different agreements.
148	0	There's TPA and TPP.
149	0	"I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about."
150	0	"And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans."
151	0	But we're getting killed in international trade right now.
152	0	And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas.
153	0	We're driving jobs overseas.
154	0	"And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry."
155	0	"But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry."
156	0	This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.
157	0	And you've got to understand.
158	0	"Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country."
159	0	"So the question is, what's the solution?"
160	0	It's easy to talk about the problems.
161	0	But do you have a solution to fix it?
162	0	And I think the solution is several things.
163	0	"Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room."
164	0	"Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back."
165	0	"And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America."
166	0	(APPLAUSE)
167	0	Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers.
168	0	Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.
169	0	Stephen.
170	0	"Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers."
171	0	Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.
172	0	You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.
173	0	Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?
174	0	If it's being abused the way Disney did.
175	0	"Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers."
176	0	"Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans."
177	0	"And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again."
178	0	The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.
179	0	"They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India."
180	0	That company then hoards up all of these visas.
181	0	They hire workers.
182	0	You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.
183	0	What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.
184	0	"They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business."
185	0	"And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it."
186	0	"It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans."
187	0	"And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future."
188	0	"Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this."
189	0	(APPLAUSE)
190	0	"You've - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured."
191	0	Correct.
192	0	Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.
193	0	"Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause."
194	0	But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.
195	0	What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.
196	0	"If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law."
197	0	"And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job."
198	0	They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.
199	0	They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.
200	0	We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.
201	0	And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.
202	0	It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.
203	0	(APPLAUSE)
204	0	"Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next."
205	0	"Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers""."
206	0	He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers.
207	0	Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?
208	0	"Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled."
209	0	The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here.
210	0	I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.
211	0	Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country.
212	0	But we clearly have to control our borders.
213	0	We can't have people just walking in.
214	0	"Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes."
215	0	The country has to be able to lock its doors as well.
216	0	"So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration."
217	0	I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border.
218	0	"And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back."
219	0	No excuses because we can't continue this problem.
220	0	"I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home."
221	0	"And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization."
222	0	Not to citizenship.
223	0	I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.
224	0	"But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget."
225	0	"We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington."
226	0	"And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor"
227	0	"Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you."
228	0	"Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like."
229	0	I will.
230	0	"First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well."
231	0	And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it.
232	0	We shouldn't have it.
233	0	"Very, very bad for workers."
234	0	"And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do."
235	0	"When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad."
236	0	It's very bad for business in terms of - and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers.
237	0	And we should end it.
238	0	"Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read."
239	0	"And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it."
240	0	Because it is a mess.
241	0	"I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on."
242	0	"We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work."
243	0	"And we're rushing into things, and we're just - we're leading with the chin."
244	0	(BELL RINGS)
245	0	We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership.
246	0	"I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years."
247	0	"Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this."
248	0	(APPLAUSE)
249	0	The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers.
250	0	What should the right level be?
251	0	"Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy."
252	0	"Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers."
253	0	What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans.
254	0	Our system isn't working.
255	0	"And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally."
256	0	"And the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website."
257	0	"We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol."
258	0	We're going to end sanctuary cities.
259	0	And let me tell you how we're going to do that.
260	0	We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.
261	0	(APPLAUSE)
262	1	We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally.
263	0	"And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems."
264	0	It's not that we don't know how to do it.
265	0	It's that we're lacking the political will.
266	0	Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.
267	0	The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.
268	0	We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country.
269	0	We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.
270	0	(APPLAUSE)
271	0	"Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?"
272	0	"Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all."
273	0	They are just coming in primarily based on family connection.
274	0	"And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system."
275	0	The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago.
276	0	The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills.
277	0	"When my parents came, they had a very limited education."
278	0	My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work.
279	0	And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school.
280	0	And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.
281	0	"But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult."
282	0	"We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards."
283	0	"The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have?"
284	0	What business are you going to open?
285	0	What investment are you going to make?
286	0	What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States?
287	0	(APPLAUSE)
288	0	Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy.
289	0	The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world.
290	0	American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.
291	0	"Mr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster."
292	0	What are your specific objections to Common Core?
293	0	"Education through Washington, D.C."
294	0	I don't want that.
295	0	I want local education.
296	0	"I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great."
297	0	"And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is..."
298	0	(APPLAUSE)
299	0	We were talking.
300	0	We spoke for over an hour on education.
301	0	And he has such a great handle on it.
302	0	He wants competitive schools.
303	0	"He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy."
304	0	But charter schools work and they work very well.
305	0	So there are a lot of things.
306	0	"But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his."
307	0	OK.
308	0	"But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards."
309	0	"So when you say ""education by Washington, D.C.,"" what do you mean?"
310	0	"You're right, Jake."
311	1	But it has been taken over by the federal government.
312	0	It was originally supposed to be that way.
313	0	And certainly sounds better that way.
314	1	"But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases."
315	0	Now in some cases they would be.
316	0	But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.
317	0	(APPLAUSE)
318	0	"Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria."
319	0	What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?
320	0	"Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards."
321	0	"First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states."
322	0	"OK, I've been working on this for many, many years."
323	0	"Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards."
324	0	"And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately."
325	0	They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.
326	0	"Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law."
327	0	"And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state."
328	0	"Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids?"
329	0	We need to start connecting them to the real world.
330	0	"We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago."
331	0	"We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs."
332	0	"Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion."
333	0	"And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be."
334	0	"So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards."
335	0	That's what it is in the state of Ohio.
336	0	(APPLAUSE)
337	0	"So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in."
338	0	You object to Common Core.
339	0	Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards.
340	0	What's wrong with that?
341	0	Common Core is a disaster.
342	0	"And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day."
343	0	(APPLAUSE)
344	0	"Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions."
345	0	The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states.
346	0	It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.
347	0	"Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that."
348	0	(APPLAUSE)
349	0	"Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments."
350	0	"And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships."
351	0	"And give every child - African American, Hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education."
352	0	(APPLAUSE)
353	0	Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida.
354	0	Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country.
355	0	"There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations."
356	0	Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.
357	0	"Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable."
358	0	"For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans."
359	0	"So, what should the new retirement age be?"
360	0	And how much will those benefits be cut?
361	0	"Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare."
362	0	"One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today."
363	0	I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother.
364	0	And we don't have to make any changes for them.
365	0	But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying.
366	0	"Any politician that goes around saying, ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you."
367	0	Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.
368	0	"So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents."
369	0	"For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68."
370	0	"If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there."
371	0	(LAUGHTER)
372	0	"If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money."
373	0	"And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better."
374	0	Medicare Advantage does that now.
375	0	"These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire."
376	0	(APPLAUSE)
377	0	"Senator, the question was specific though."
378	0	"You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?"
379	0	"Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part."
380	0	"So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68."
381	0	We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70.
382	0	And so my children would retire at 70.
383	0	I would retire at 68.
384	0	It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.
385	0	But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old.
386	0	We're years away from retirement.
387	0	"For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all."
388	0	"If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis."
389	0	It's not a question of if.
390	0	It is a question of when.
391	0	"In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt."
392	0	That's - all of it will be eaten up by that.
393	0	That's a debt crisis.
394	0	And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.
395	0	(APPLAUSE)
396	0	"Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans."
397	0	"But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years."
398	0	"So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?"
399	0	"Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security."
400	0	They're leaving it the way it is.
401	0	"In fact, they want to increase it."
402	0	They want to actually give more.
403	0	And that's what we're up against.
404	0	"And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against."
405	0	"I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant."
406	0	And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.
407	0	Not increase the age and to leave it as is.
408	0	"You have 22 years, you have a long time to go."
409	0	"It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it."
410	0	"I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP..."
411	1	"I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters."
412	0	If that ever happened in China.
413	0	you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before.
414	0	"They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a - it's a national tragedy."
415	1	"We're at zero, we're not doing anything."
416	0	We've lost our jobs.
417	0	We've lost everything.
418	0	We're losing everything.
419	0	"Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country."
420	0	I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is.
421	0	"We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business."
422	0	(APPLAUSE)
423	0	"Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in."
424	0	"Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump."
425	0	"You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent."
426	0	So how would you find that other $147 million?
427	0	Because they don't cover most of the subjects.
428	0	We're the policemen of the world.
429	0	We take care of the entire world.
430	0	"We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger."
431	0	Our military is depleted.
432	0	"But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea."
433	0	"We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships."
434	0	We get virtually nothing.
435	0	"We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea."
436	0	We have so many places.
437	0	"Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them."
438	0	We are going to be in a different world.
439	0	"We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country."
440	0	We owe $19 trillion.
441	0	We're going to bring wealth back to our country.
442	0	(APPLAUSE)
443	0	"Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?"
444	0	No.
445	0	And I - and I think you've outlined why.
446	0	The numbers don't add up.
447	0	"You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign."
448	0	"In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida."
449	0	Fraud is not enough.
450	0	"Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up."
451	0	You already gave those numbers.
452	0	The second point is on foreign aid.
453	0	I hear that all the time as well.
454	0	"I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget."
455	0	The numbers don't add up.
456	0	The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse.
457	0	"Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid."
458	0	But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.
459	0	And here's the thing.
460	0	"If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis."
461	0	Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare.
462	0	Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it.
463	0	It is one of the major issues confronting America.
464	0	It's barely been asked in any of these debates.
465	0	And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.
466	0	(APPLAUSE)
467	0	"Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up."
468	0	What's your response?
469	0	Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up.
470	0	"What's your response, Mr. Trump?"
471	0	"Well, I don't know if he's saying that."
472	0	"Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it."
473	0	I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets.
474	0	We don't bid things out.
475	0	"We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry."
476	0	They don't go out to bid.
477	0	They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store.
478	0	That's what they're paying.
479	0	And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby.
480	0	"They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen."
481	0	They have great power and they don't bid out.
482	0	The military is never properly bid.
483	0	"When we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid."
484	0	"And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?"
485	1	I'm self-funding my campaign.
486	0	Nobody is going to be taking care of me.
487	0	I don't want anybody's money.
488	0	I will tell you something.
489	0	We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government.
490	0	We're going to save a fortune.
491	0	(APPLAUSE)
492	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
493	0	"Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts."
494	0	What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?
495	0	"Well, number one, we need to see responsibility."
496	0	"Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible."
497	0	And any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader.
498	0	We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security.
499	0	(APPLAUSE)
500	0	"And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever."
501	0	Every benefit will be protected to the letter.
502	0	"But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation."
503	0	"And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids."
504	0	(APPLAUSE)
505	0	And one of the things that is critically important.
506	0	"Listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world."
507	0	But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away.
508	0	You have to understand the problems.
509	0	You have to have real solutions.
510	0	It's like government spending.
511	0	It is very easy.
512	0	"Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse."
513	0	"If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem."
514	0	You know what?
515	0	That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem.
516	0	(APPLAUSE)
517	0	Here's my philosophy.
518	0	"The less government, the more freedom."
519	0	"The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity."
520	0	And there are bureaucrats in...
521	0	(BELL RINGS)
522	0	"... Washington right now who are killing jobs and I'll tell you, I know who they are."
523	0	I will find them and I will fire them.
524	0	Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?
525	0	I will let Donald speak for himself.
526	0	"But I will say, there's a reason, in my campaign I've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion."
527	0	"I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs."
528	0	"And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that?"
529	0	"Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you."
530	0	"When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked."
531	0	Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary.
532	1	"When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide."
533	0	You can't take on ethanol in Iowa.
534	0	And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same.
535	0	They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.
536	0	(BELL RINGS)
537	0	"If we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer."
538	0	(APPLAUSE)
539	0	Thank you Senator Cruz.
540	0	"Mr. Trump, would you like to respond?"
541	0	Yes.
542	1	"If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit."
543	0	He did and - at the end.
544	1	"Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well."
545	0	"And you know, I think everybody knows that."
546	1	"It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change."
547	0	Senator Cruz?
548	0	"Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington?"
549	0	"It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington."
550	0	"But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington."
551	0	"When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare."
552	0	(APPLAUSE)
553	0	"When I led the fight against amnesty, it's because I was standing with the people..."
554	0	(BELL RINGS)
555	0	... against Washington.
556	0	"And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?"
557	0	"OK. Mr. Trump, I'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I'm going to move to Governor Kasich."
558	0	Go ahead.
559	0	"Well, that's fine."
560	1	"First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty."
561	0	So there's no question about that.
562	0	And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe.
563	0	"And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me."
564	0	And there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions.
565	0	I would say this.
566	0	We're all in this together.
567	0	We're going to come up with solutions.
568	0	We're going to find the answers to things.
569	0	And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.
570	0	(APPLAUSE)
571	0	"Governor Kasich, let's get back to Social Security."
572	0	"You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, ""Get over cuts to Social Security benefits"" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there."
573	0	Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?
574	0	"Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington."
575	0	I took on Washington and I won.
576	0	"I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee."
577	0	We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt.
578	0	We also balanced the budget four years in a row.
579	0	And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.
580	0	"I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts."
581	0	Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.
582	0	I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.
583	0	"If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it."
584	0	It will just simply be less.
585	0	"And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit."
586	0	That's the way it will work.
587	0	And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age.
588	0	And how do I know that?
589	0	I've done all this before.
590	0	This is not a theory.
591	0	Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget?
592	0	Yes.
593	0	It doesn't mean you have to cut them.
594	0	"It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century."
595	0	"So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black."
596	0	Our credit is strong.
597	1	"We're up 400,000 jobs."
598	0	And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.
599	0	"And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result."
600	0	(APPLAUSE)
601	0	"Thank you, Governor."
602	0	Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now.
603	0	"Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition."
604	0	How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader?
605	0	What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?
606	0	"Well, first of all, I don't really think that."
607	0	I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people.
608	0	We are more inclusive.
609	0	"And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story."
610	0	"You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening."
611	0	"I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade."
612	0	"I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals."
613	0	"The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs."
614	0	"You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed."
615	0	So that's that.
616	0	"But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country."
617	0	"The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game."
618	0	and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.
619	0	"If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs."
620	0	"And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up."
621	0	It has gone down.
622	0	And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.
623	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
624	0	Senator Cruz...
625	0	(APPLAUSE)
626	0	... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote.
627	0	Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party.
628	0	What do you think is wrong with that vision?
629	0	"Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade."
630	0	He's right about the problems.
631	0	But his solutions don't work.
632	0	"So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods."
633	0	Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight.
634	0	I don't know where he'll be tonight.
635	0	But I'll tell you what happens.
636	0	"You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression."
637	0	"And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent."
638	0	"But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs."
639	0	"A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs."
640	0	Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.
641	0	(APPLAUSE)
642	0	"Mr. Trump, we'll give you a chance to respond."
643	0	The 45 percent tax is a threat.
644	0	"It was not a tax, it was a threat."
645	0	It will be a tax if they don't behave.
646	0	Take China as an example.
647	0	"I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China."
648	0	They can't.
649	0	China won't let them.
650	0	We talk about free trade.
651	0	"It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade."
652	0	China dumps everything that they have over here.
653	0	"No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything."
654	0	We can't get into China.
655	0	"I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in."
656	0	"When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax."
657	0	"The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you."
658	0	"It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less."
659	0	But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.
660	0	(APPLAUSE)
661	0	Senator Cruz?
662	0	"Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said."
663	0	He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat.
664	0	"And mind you, you are paying the tax."
665	0	It's not China that pays the tax.
666	0	"It's you, the working men and women."
667	0	So ask yourself at home
668	0	How is this helping you?
669	0	"If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, ""I'm going to jack - I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing."""
670	0	That hurts you.
671	0	"It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem."
672	0	Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.
673	0	OK.
674	0	"Jake, I have to say - honestly, it's just the opposite."
675	0	"What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants."
676	0	"Instead of in China, we'll build them here."
677	0	"And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off."
678	1	And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.
679	0	So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products.
680	0	And that's the way it should be done.
681	0	"And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble."
682	0	"It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me."
683	0	All right.
684	0	We're going to take a very quick break.
685	0	"When we come back, we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this."
686	0	Stay with us.
687	0	(APPLAUSE)
688	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
689	0	"Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida."
690	0	"Mr. Trump, let me start with you."
691	0	"Last night, you told CNN quote, ""Islam hates us?"""
692	0	Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.
693	0	I mean a lot of them.
694	0	I mean a lot of them.
695	0	Do you want to clarify the comment at all?
696	0	"Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today."
697	0	And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam.
698	0	But I will tell you this.
699	0	"There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred."
700	0	And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.
701	0	(APPLAUSE)
702	0	"Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry - Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize."
703	0	"Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this."
704	0	Do you agree?
705	0	"Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say."
706	0	"The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want."
707	0	"It has consequences, here and around the world."
708	0	(APPLAUSE)
709	0	And so let me give you one.
710	0	"Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh."
711	0	It's a very tough place to be a missionary.
712	0	It's Muslim.
713	0	"And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them."
714	0	And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well.
715	0	"And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims."
716	0	So this is a real impact.
717	0	There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.
718	0	"I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there."
719	0	If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.
720	0	(APPLAUSE)
721	0	And they love America.
722	0	"And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military."
723	0	Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America.
724	0	No matter what their religious background may be.
725	0	Mr. Trump?
726	0	(APPLAUSE)
727	0	Marco talks about consequences.
728	0	"Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House."
729	0	There have been a lot of problems.
730	0	"Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want."
731	0	I don't want to be so politically correct.
732	0	I like to solve problems.
733	0	"We have a serious, serious problem of hate."
734	0	(APPLAUSE)
735	0	There is tremendous hate.
736	0	There is tremendous hate.
737	0	"Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means."
738	0	Let me go a step further.
739	0	Women are treated horribly.
740	0	You know that.
741	0	You do know that.
742	0	"Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad."
743	0	(BELL RINGS)
744	0	"Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred."
745	0	"The question was asked, what do you think?"
746	0	"I said, there is hatred."
747	0	Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently.
748	0	"And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful."
749	0	"Mr. Trump, thank you."
750	0	We better solve the problem before it's too late.
751	0	Senator Rubio?
752	0	(APPLAUSE)
753	0	"Well, here we go."
754	0	"See, I'm not interested in being politically correct."
755	0	I'm not interested in being politically correct.
756	0	I'm interested in being correct.
757	0	(APPLAUSE)
758	0	"And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line."
759	0	We do work.
760	0	There is - Islam has a major problem on its hands.
761	0	"It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized."
762	0	And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.
763	0	There is no doubt about that.
764	0	"It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other - with Muslims, who do not - who are not radicals."
765	0	We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.
766	0	We're going to have to work with the Saudis.
767	0	We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms.
768	0	"We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS."
769	0	(BELL RING)
770	0	It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.
771	0	And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct.
772	0	We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.
773	0	"Thank you, Senator."
774	0	(APPLAUSE)
775	0	"Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?"
776	0	"No, I don't."
777	0	"I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today."
778	0	There isn't any question.
779	0	And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.
780	0	"But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait."
781	0	"The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries."
782	0	And they are Egypt.
783	0	And they are Saudi Arabia.
784	0	And they are Jordan.
785	0	And they are the Gulf states.
786	0	And we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey.
787	0	And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe.
788	0	"The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just - they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith."
789	0	"Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view."
790	0	"But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world."
791	0	"And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody."
792	0	"Thank you, Governor Kasich."
793	0	"Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign."
794	0	"You said that the U.S. has to, quote, ""take out"" the families of terrorists."
795	0	"When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, ""So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?"""
796	0	"It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians."
797	0	"So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?"
798	0	Let me go back to the other just for a second.
799	0	"In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting ""death to the USA."""
800	0	"Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me."
801	0	"As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law - this all started with your question on water boarding."
802	0	We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding.
803	0	They have no laws.
804	0	They have no rules.
805	0	They have no regulations.
806	0	They chop off heads.
807	0	"They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead."
808	0	And we're working on a different set of parameters.
809	0	"Now, we have to obey the laws."
810	0	Have to obey the laws.
811	0	"But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad."
812	0	"We better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us."
813	0	"They are laughing at us, believe me."
814	0	(APPLAUSE)
815	0	"Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?"
816	0	"No, of course not."
817	0	And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists.
818	0	The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward.
819	0	"It's difficult to do, but it has to be done."
820	0	"When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung."
821	0	They're going to be expanded.
822	0	And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.
823	0	"And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because - because Barack Obama is gutting our military."
824	0	"He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had."
825	0	We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them.
826	0	"And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent."
827	0	And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan.
828	0	"They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally."
829	0	(APPLAUSE)
830	0	"Senator Cruz, you've talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS."
831	0	Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?
832	0	"No, of course not."
833	0	We've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now.
834	0	"But listen, Jake, I understand."
835	0	"People are scared and for seven years, we've faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia."
836	0	That is maddening.
837	0	"But the answer is not simply to yell, ""China bad, Muslims bad."""
838	0	You've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them.
839	0	"And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us."
840	0	"We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them."
841	0	"And I'll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal."
842	0	I think that's a mistake.
843	0	The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us.
844	0	"I'll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism."
845	0	"On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians."
846	0	"As president, I will not be neutral."
847	0	"And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force."
848	0	"He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran."
849	0	"He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief..."
850	0	(BELL RINGS)
851	0	"... who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel."
852	0	(APPLAUSE)
853	0	Thank you Senator Cruz.
854	0	Mr. Trump.
855	0	"We're going to come to you in a second, but wait."
856	0	"I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject."
857	0	"Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used."
858	0	"You said you would want to be, quote, ""sort of a neutral guy""."
859	0	He did mention Taylor Force.
860	0	"He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero."
861	0	He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.
862	0	"He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed."
863	0	And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this.
864	0	Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.
865	0	"First of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am."
866	0	OK.
867	0	There's nobody.
868	0	(APPLAUSE)
869	0	I am pro-Israel.
870	0	(BOOING)
871	0	"I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue."
872	0	I've made massive contributions to Israel.
873	0	I have a lot of - I have tremendous love for Israel.
874	0	"I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK?"
875	0	And two grandchildren that are Jewish.
876	0	(APPLAUSE)
877	0	"But I will tell you, I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is - I'm a negotiator."
878	0	"If I go in, I'll say I'm pro-Israel and I've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen."
879	0	"But I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done."
880	0	Maybe we can get a deal.
881	0	I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time.
882	0	But maybe we can get a deal done.
883	0	Senator Trump...
884	0	(CROSSTALK)
885	0	"And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal."
886	0	I think it's maybe the world deal I've ever seen.
887	0	I think it's the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.
888	0	"I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely."
889	0	That deal will be broken.
890	0	Thank you Mr. Trump.
891	0	Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.
892	0	"You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country."
893	0	"The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they're our strongest ally in the region."
894	0	"We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources."
895	0	"And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel."
896	0	"The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization."
897	0	They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people.
898	0	And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has.
899	0	"And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad."
900	0	"Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical..."
901	0	(BELL RINGS)
902	0	... Islamic terrorist.
903	0	Senator Rubio.
904	0	He's hunting them down and stomping them.
905	0	Thank you.
906	0	Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.
907	0	I want to go back to the Israeli government's assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence.
908	0	Do you agree.
909	0	"Well, that's undeniable."
910	0	"First of all, they've said, they've encouraged people to do so."
911	0	And you've seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things.
912	0	But let me go back for a moment.
913	0	"The policy Donald has outlined, I don't know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy."
914	0	Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy.
915	0	There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment.
916	0	There just isn't.
917	0	(APPLAUSE)
918	0	Because there's no one to negotiate with.
919	0	"The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state."
920	0	"Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel."
921	0	And that's what will happen again.
922	0	These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel.
923	0	What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory.
924	0	(BELL RINGS)
925	0	"So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now."
926	0	"Mr. Trump, and then I'll come to you Senator Kasich."
927	0	And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel's enemies.
928	0	Thank you senator.
929	0	(APPLAUSE)
930	0	Mr. Trump a response and then we'll go to Governor Kasich.
931	0	"If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look."
932	0	But I would like to give it a shot.
933	0	"Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel."
934	0	But I would love to give it a shot.
935	0	"And I have to tell you this, Hugh."
936	0	"I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it's tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel."
937	0	And some believe it's possible.
938	0	"It may not be, in which case we'll find out."
939	0	But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.
940	0	"Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence?"
941	0	"Well, there's no question."
942	0	They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock.
943	0	"And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in."
944	0	Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?
945	0	"Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you're familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel."
946	0	"They're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground."
947	0	"And I just have to tell you this, I don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution."
948	0	And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do.
949	0	I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel.
950	0	(APPLAUSE)
951	0	"Thank you, Governor."
952	0	"Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region."
953	0	"Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix - to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq."
954	0	"From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon."
955	0	So here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground.
956	0	Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?
957	0	We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS.
958	0	And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment.
959	0	Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have.
960	0	We're not using our overwhelming air power.
961	0	We're not arming the Kurds.
962	0	Those need to be the first steps.
963	0	And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.
964	0	"But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement."
965	0	We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.
966	0	They're not able to fight.
967	0	They're not able to defend themselves.
968	0	They're not able to kill the enemy.
969	0	"And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong."
970	0	It is immoral.
971	0	"And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017."
972	0	(APPLAUSE)
973	0	"Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that's what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?"
974	0	"Hugh, I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief."
975	0	"I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years."
976	0	We absolutely have to win this with a coalition.
977	0	Arabs have to be with us.
978	0	The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer - is as close as it is to us.
979	0	"And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground."
980	0	And you bring all the force you need.
981	0	"It has got to be ""shock and awe"" in the military-speak."
982	0	"Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes."
983	0	"Mr. Trump, more troops?"
984	0	We really have no choice.
985	0	We have to knock out ISIS.
986	0	We have to knock the hell out of them.
987	0	We have to get rid of it.
988	0	"And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart."
989	0	We have no choice.
990	0	How many...
991	0	(CROSSTALK)
992	0	"I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000."
993	0	We have to knock them out fast.
994	0	"Look, we're not allowed to fight."
995	0	We can't fight.
996	1	We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.
997	0	"I mean, these are things that nobody even believes."
998	0	They think we're kidding.
999	1	They didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint.
1000	0	We don't fight like we used to fight.
1001	0	We used to fight to win.
1002	0	Now we fight for no reason whatsoever.
1003	0	We don't even know what we're doing.
1004	0	(APPLAUSE)
1005	0	"So, the answer is we have to knock them out."
1006	0	We have to knock them out fast.
1007	0	And we have to get back home.
1008	0	And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.
1009	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
1010	0	Let's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.
1011	0	"Senator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A."
1012	0	The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.
1013	0	What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?
1014	0	"Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A."
1015	0	my brother is a veteran.
1016	0	He's struggling with the V.A.
1017	0	"The other day, we heard this horrible story."
1018	0	"It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, ""Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail."""
1019	0	"Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen - one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide."
1020	0	And they happened to call him back the day after he died.
1021	0	People need to be held accountable for this.
1022	0	"One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit - Bernie Sanders was a part of this - we passed a V.A. accountability bill."
1023	0	"And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job."
1024	0	Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working.
1025	0	The problem is no one's being held accountable.
1026	0	"Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach."
1027	0	No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail.
1028	0	No one's been disciplined.
1029	0	No one's been demoted.
1030	0	"When I'm president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A."
1031	0	(APPLAUSE)
1032	0	"Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget."
1033	0	"As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill."
1034	0	Should veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?
1035	0	"I don't - I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake."
1036	0	My initial instincts are no.
1037	0	And let me just say about the V.A.
1038	0	"When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one."
1039	0	"Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured."
1040	0	It needs to be downsized and spread out.
1041	0	It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.
1042	0	"And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job."
1043	0	"And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees."
1044	0	No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.
1045	0	"Thank you, Governor Kasich."
1046	0	(APPLAUSE)
1047	0	Let's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida.
1048	0	"Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba."
1049	0	Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States.
1050	0	Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.
1051	0	"Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba."
1052	0	The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well.
1053	0	"So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?"
1054	0	"Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change."
1055	0	"But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government."
1056	0	"Today, it has not."
1057	0	"The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime."
1058	0	It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone.
1059	0	They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there.
1060	0	They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president.
1061	0	And nothing will change for the Cuban people.
1062	0	There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights.
1063	0	"In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening."
1064	0	The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.
1065	0	And we asked nothing in return.
1066	0	Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma.
1067	0	And by no means is Burma a perfect country.
1068	0	"But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings."
1069	0	"When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening."
1070	0	"And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body."
1071	0	He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return.
1072	0	"And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions."
1073	0	"It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing."
1074	0	(APPLAUSE)
1075	0	"Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine."
1076	0	You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine.
1077	0	Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?
1078	0	"Well, I don't really agree with President Obama."
1079	0	I think I'm somewhere in the middle.
1080	0	"What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don't make good deal."
1081	0	"We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue."
1082	0	"As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion."
1083	0	All that stuff has to be agreed to now.
1084	0	We don't want to get sued after the deal is made.
1085	0	"So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place."
1086	0	"After 50 years, it's enough time, folks."
1087	0	But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.
1088	0	"This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations."
1089	0	"So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently."
1090	0	We have to make good deal.
1091	0	"Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in."
1092	0	"But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?"
1093	0	"I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor."
1094	0	"Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor."
1095	0	It the same way as the Iran deal.
1096	0	We never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving.
1097	0	We give and give and give.
1098	0	"But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it."
1099	0	Which would it be?
1100	0	In Havana.
1101	0	I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States.
1102	0	(APPLAUSE)
1103	0	"All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate."
1104	0	It's the same building.
1105	0	So it could just go back to being called a consulate.
1106	0	We don't have to close it that way.
1107	0	"Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose."
1108	0	(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
1109	0	"Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal."
1110	0	"I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified."
1111	0	"Here's a good deal - Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs."
1112	0	And you know what?
1113	0	Then we can have a relationship with Cuba.
1114	0	That's a good deal.
1115	0	(APPLAUSE)
1116	0	"Thank you, Senator Rubio."
1117	0	"Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?"
1118	0	"Yes, I would."
1119	0	"And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters."
1120	0	"When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy?"
1121	0	"When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry."
1122	0	There's a real difference between us.
1123	0	Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.
1124	0	And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing.
1125	0	"The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective."
1126	0	"I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us."
1127	0	(APPLAUSE)
1128	0	Thank you Senator Cruz.
1129	0	Mr. Trump.
1130	0	"Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar."
1131	0	I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us.
1132	0	And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear.
1133	0	"And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States."
1134	0	"As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal."
1135	0	"That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country."
1136	0	It is a disaster.
1137	0	"So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated."
1138	0	"So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it."
1139	0	"Senator Cruz, your response?"
1140	0	"Well, look."
1141	0	"I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008."
1142	0	"And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry."
1143	0	"And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better."
1144	0	No.
1145	0	We don't just need smarter people in government.
1146	0	We need leaders that are protecting American interests.
1147	0	(APPLAUSE)
1148	0	"And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion."
1149	0	That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.
1150	0	We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies...
1151	0	(BELL RINGS)
1152	0	... understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security.
1153	0	(APPLAUSE)
1154	0	I was against the giving of the money at all cost.
1155	0	I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back.
1156	0	If the prisoners don't come back early - three years ago.
1157	0	"One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way."
1158	0	"If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate."
1159	0	They come back early.
1160	0	"What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions."
1161	0	What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal.
1162	0	Cause that deal is a disaster.
1163	0	"Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators."
1164	0	"But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States."
1165	0	Thank you Mr. Trump.
1166	0	Let's refocus this back on Cuba.
1167	0	"Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms."
1168	0	This is a direct result of President Obama's policy in Cuba that we've been talking about.
1169	0	If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?
1170	0	"No, I wouldn't."
1171	0	"Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing?"
1172	0	"You know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are."
1173	0	"You won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people."
1174	0	You had a red line in Syria.
1175	0	You walked away from it.
1176	0	"You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile."
1177	0	And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal.
1178	0	"Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends."
1179	0	And you know what happens when you do that?
1180	0	You make a terrible mistake.
1181	0	"You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here..."
1182	0	(APPLAUSE)
1183	0	... and you need to negotiate tough deals.
1184	0	"The fact is, they need to understand who we are."
1185	0	The Chinese understand.
1186	0	They don't own the South China Sea.
1187	0	They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems.
1188	0	We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.
1189	0	"We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us."
1190	0	We're not rattling a sword.
1191	0	You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.
1192	0	And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for.
1193	0	Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.
1194	0	(BELL RINGS)
1195	0	"When I'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back."
1196	0	Thank you governor.
1197	0	Thank you governor.
1198	0	"While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening."
1199	0	"Mayor Regalado told me, quote, ""Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?"""
1200	0	Unquote.
1201	0	"Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you."
1202	0	Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?
1203	1	"Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing."
1204	0	(APPLAUSE)
1205	1	There's never been a time when the climate has not changed.
1206	0	"I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?"
1207	0	"So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things."
1208	0	"Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp."
1209	0	"And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation."
1210	0	And I have long supported mitigation efforts.
1211	0	"But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing."
1212	0	(APPLAUSE)
1213	0	"On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass."
1214	0	There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.
1215	0	Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that?
1216	0	Americans are going to pay the price of that.
1217	0	"The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living."
1218	0	The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.
1219	0	And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment?
1220	1	"Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels."
1221	0	"So, I am in favor of a clean environment."
1222	0	My children live in South Florida.
1223	0	My family is being raised here.
1224	0	"I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy."
1225	0	"So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change."
1226	0	"When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?"
1227	0	I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that.
1228	1	"If we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment."
1229	1	Sea level would still rise.
1230	0	All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.
1231	0	"One, because America is not a planet."
1232	0	It's a country.
1233	1	"And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut."
1234	0	Here's what he will immediately - and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.
1235	0	"He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power."
1236	0	That cost will be passed on to working families.
1237	0	I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.
1238	0	(APPLAUSE)
1239	0	"Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami?"
1240	0	"Well, I - I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs."
1241	0	"The fact is, you can have both."
1242	0	"In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent."
1243	0	But let me tell you also what we're trying to do.
1244	0	We want all the sources of energy.
1245	0	"We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it."
1246	0	We believe in natural gas.
1247	0	We believe in nuclear power.
1248	0	And you know what else I believe in?
1249	0	"I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter."
1250	0	"Now, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute."
1251	0	But it is important we develop renewables.
1252	0	Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.
1253	0	So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.
1254	0	"Thank you, Governor."
1255	0	"Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world."
1256	0	"Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad."
1257	0	"He said, quote, ""foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed."""
1258	0	Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?
1259	0	Of course it does.
1260	0	"And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world."
1261	1	This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.
1262	1	Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America.
1263	0	Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on.
1264	0	"I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, ""it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us."""
1265	0	And that is a disgrace.
1266	0	"But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before."
1267	0	"We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter."
1268	0	"And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight."
1269	1	It's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.
1270	0	(APPLAUSE)
1271	0	"And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies."
1272	0	"That's why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons."
1273	0	(APPLAUSE)
1274	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1275	0	"Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said"
1276	0	"When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength."
1277	0	"Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators."
1278	0	"You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said ""That shows you the power of strength."""
1279	0	How do you respond...
1280	0	That doesn't mean I was endorsing that.
1281	0	I was not endorsing it.
1282	0	"I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength."
1283	0	And then they kept down the riot.
1284	0	It was a horrible thing.
1285	0	It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it.
1286	0	"As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia."
1287	0	"I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you."
1288	0	"I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin."
1289	0	But the word strong obviously is a compliment...
1290	0	(APPLAUSE)
1291	0	... and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.
1292	0	I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany.
1293	0	Germany is a disaster right now.
1294	0	So I used to think that.
1295	0	(APPLAUSE)
1296	0	And strong doesn't mean good.
1297	0	"Putin is a strong leader, absolutely."
1298	0	I could name many strong leaders.
1299	0	I could name very many very weak leaders.
1300	0	But he is a strong leader.
1301	0	Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way.
1302	0	I say it as a fact.
1303	0	"Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre."
1304	0	What do you think?
1305	0	I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids.
1306	0	"And when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government."
1307	0	(APPLAUSE)
1308	0	"Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy."
1309	0	They are a competitor.
1310	0	But I want to go back to three things they should do.
1311	0	"We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one."
1312	0	"Number two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea."
1313	0	And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea.
1314	0	"And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command."
1315	0	"And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid."
1316	0	"But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems."
1317	0	The president has not given the cyber command that authority.
1318	0	I will.
1319	0	"And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency."
1320	0	That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with.
1321	0	"And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected."
1322	0	(APPLAUSE)
1323	0	"Thank you, Governor Kasich."
1324	0	We're going to take another quick break.
1325	0	"When we come back, we'll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this."
1326	0	Stay with us.
1327	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1328	0	(APPLAUSE)
1329	0	"Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida."
1330	0	"Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block."
1331	0	"Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina."
1332	0	This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.
1333	0	"Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign."
1334	0	"She said, quote, ""this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence."""
1335	0	Do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?
1336	0	I hope not.
1337	0	I truly hope not.
1338	0	I will say this.
1339	0	"We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people - you've seen it yourself."
1340	0	"People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest - in some cases - you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like."
1341	0	"But when they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable."
1342	0	They have anger.
1343	0	They love this country.
1344	0	"They don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated."
1345	0	"And I know - I mean, I see it."
1346	0	There is some anger.
1347	0	There's also great love for the country.
1348	0	It's a beautiful thing in many respects.
1349	0	"But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake."
1350	0	"Some of your critics point to quotes you've made at these debates - at these rallies including February 23rd, ""I'd like to punch him in the face,"" referring to a protesters."
1351	0	"February 27th, ""in the good ol' days, they'd have ripped him out of that seat so fast."""
1352	0	"February 1st, ""knock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise."""
1353	0	(APPLAUSE)
1354	0	"We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things."
1355	0	"They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people."
1356	0	"And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don't mind."
1357	0	But doing serious damage.
1358	0	"And if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something."
1359	0	And it's not me.
1360	0	"It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums."
1361	0	"I mean, we fill up stadiums."
1362	0	"It's usually the police - and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job."
1363	0	(APPLAUSE)
1364	0	So we should pay - we should truly give our police.
1365	0	"They're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive."
1366	0	(APPLAUSE)
1367	0	"Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election?"
1368	0	"Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people."
1369	0	We need to remember who it is we're working for.
1370	0	"You know, we've seen for seven years a president who believes he's above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he's working for the American people."
1371	0	"And let me - let me ask, turn the camera our here."
1372	0	How many of y'all feel disrespected by Washington?
1373	0	(APPLAUSE)
1374	0	Washington isn't listening to the people.
1375	0	And that's the frustration that is boiling over.
1376	0	"And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people."
1377	0	"You know, at Donald's rallies recently, he's taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him."
1378	0	"Now, I got to say to me, I think that's exactly backwards."
1379	0	This is a job interview.
1380	0	"We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around."
1381	0	(APPLAUSE)
1382	0	"And the only hand raising I'm interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the..."
1383	0	(BELL RINGS)
1384	0	"... bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States."
1385	0	Thank you senator.
1386	0	"Mr. Trump, if you'd like to respond."
1387	0	It shows the total dishonesty of the press.
1388	0	"We were having - on a few occasions, again massive crowds."
1389	0	And we're talking and I'm saying who is going to vote on Tuesday?
1390	0	Who is going to vote?
1391	0	The place goes crazy.
1392	0	"Then I say, hey, do me a favor."
1393	0	Raise your right hand.
1394	0	Do you swear you're going to vote for Donald Trump?
1395	0	"Everyone's laughing, we're all having a good time."
1396	0	"That's why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine."
1397	0	(APPLAUSE)
1398	0	"But we're all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many."
1399	0	"Because when you look at it, everyone's smiling, laughing."
1400	0	Their arms are raised like this.
1401	0	"They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany."
1402	0	(BELL RINGS)
1403	0	It is a disgrace.
1404	0	It was a total disgrace.
1405	0	"And I've had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that - what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace."
1406	0	(APPLAUSE)
1407	0	"Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party's chances in November?"
1408	0	"Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period."
1409	0	"I mean, it's - you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters."
1410	0	"Jake, here's what I think is happening."
1411	0	There are people out there who are worried about their jobs.
1412	0	"They're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job, a man and a woman."
1413	0	Maybe they're worried about a trade deal.
1414	0	They're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up.
1415	0	"They're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great."
1416	0	"They went to college, they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement."
1417	0	People are uptight.
1418	0	Our seniors are worried they're going to lose their Social Security.
1419	0	There's two ways to treat it.
1420	0	"You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed."
1421	0	"If we're Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems."
1422	0	"We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy."
1423	0	(BELL RINGS)
1424	0	And you know what?
1425	0	They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I'll give them the power to do it.
1426	0	Thank you governor.
1427	0	Senator Rubio?
1428	0	I know you want to say something.
1429	0	I do.
1430	0	A couple of points.
1431	0	"The first is, I'm concerned about violence in general in this society."
1432	0	"And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers."
1433	0	And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us.
1434	0	On the issue of anger.
1435	0	"Yes, people are angry."
1436	0	Of course they're angry.
1437	0	Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years.
1438	0	"But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us."
1439	0	But to motivate us to take action.
1440	0	Being here in Miami is special.
1441	0	My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up.
1442	0	And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history.
1443	0	My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky.
1444	0	"One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon."
1445	0	(BELL RINGS)
1446	0	You know what he said when he saw that?
1447	0	He said Americans can do anything.
1448	0	Americans can do anything.
1449	0	"There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation."
1450	0	Thank you senator.
1451	0	And embrace all of the principles that made us great.
1452	0	Thank you senator.
1453	0	(APPLAUSE)
1454	0	"The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention."
1455	0	Let's go back to Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt.
1456	0	Thank you Jake.
1457	0	"Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention."
1458	0	"If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates."
1459	0	"Why shouldn't the person with the most delegates, even if it's not a majority of delegates, be the nominee?"
1460	0	"Well, first of all, let's not - you know, math doesn't tell the whole story in politics."
1461	0	"The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what's true today is not necessarily true tomorrow."
1462	0	So let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1463	0	"Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK."
1464	0	"If you got an 86, you got a B."
1465	0	Because everybody else had an 84 didn't mean you got an A.
1466	0	So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.
1467	0	"And frankly, I don't know if we're going to get a convention like that."
1468	0	"But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him."
1469	0	He tried valiantly.
1470	0	He lost.
1471	0	Gerald Ford won.
1472	0	The party was united.
1473	0	Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon.
1474	0	"He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first."
1475	0	And we were healed as a party.
1476	0	"So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked."
1477	0	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1478	0	We don't know what's going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected.
1479	0	And that's what's going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks.
1480	0	(APPLAUSE)
1481	0	"Thank you, Governor."
1482	0	"Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee?"
1483	0	"And if so, would you support that person?"
1484	0	"I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever - first of all, I think I'm going to have the delegates."
1485	0	OK?
1486	0	I think.
1487	0	Let's see what happens.
1488	0	(APPLAUSE)
1489	0	"But if somebody doesn't have the delegates, and I guess there's two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment."
1490	0	"But if - no, that's just - by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism."
1491	0	That's just a mathematical fact.
1492	0	OK?
1493	0	"If two of us get up there, I would say this, if - if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win."
1494	0	hat's what I think.
1495	0	"Senator Cruz, if you - if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election?"
1496	0	"Well, look, there are some folks in Washington..."
1497	0	Make me president.
1498	0	(APPLAUSE)
1499	0	"Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian."
1500	0	(APPLAUSE)
1501	0	"You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention."
1502	0	They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee.
1503	0	I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters.
1504	0	(APPLAUSE)
1505	0	"It's one of the reasons why in the course of this election - listen, everyone up here has worked very hard."
1506	0	"But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself."
1507	0	"At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates."
1508	0	He has about 100 more than I have.
1509	0	"We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him."
1510	0	"And so for the people at home, if you're one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins."
1511	0	That's why the media wants him to be the nominee so much.
1512	0	"If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you've supported other candidates, come and join us."
1513	0	We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting.
1514	0	It's why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday.
1515	0	It's why Mike Lee endorsed me today.
1516	0	I ask everyone to come together.
1517	0	Let's stand together and let's beat Hillary Clinton in November.
1518	0	All right.
1519	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1520	0	(APPLAUSE)
1521	0	"Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio."
1522	0	"You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he's always saying, ""I'm the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him."""
1523	0	But I beat him in 13 contests.
1524	0	He never mentions that.
1525	0	(APPLAUSE)
1526	0	"And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact."
1527	0	"I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted."
1528	1	"The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken."
1529	0	"And each week, I get better and better."
1530	0	"And believe me, I haven't even started on her yet."
1531	0	Senator Rubio?
1532	0	Let me tell you what this election is about for me.
1533	0	And I get all the delegate math and all that debate.
1534	0	Let me tell you what's about for me.
1535	0	"On Tuesday night, I didn't do as well, obviously, as I wanted to."
1536	0	And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home.
1537	0	"And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting."
1538	0	There's a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery.
1539	0	And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting.
1540	0	"But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says ""Marco Rubio."""
1541	0	"Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves"
1542	0	(APPLAUSE)
1543	0	That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him.
1544	0	I am going to work tirelessly every single day -
1545	0	(APPLAUSE)
1546	0	... because this election is too important.
1547	0	What's at stake is the future of this country.
1548	0	"And I believe - I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I've always believed that God has blessed America, that God's hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come."
1549	0	(APPLAUSE)
1550	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1551	0	Let's send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.
1552	0	Stephen?
1553	0	"Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors."
1554	0	Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election?
1555	0	I have not made that decision yet.
1556	0	"I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision."
1557	0	My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth.
1558	0	"I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I'm turning down money."
1559	0	I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you.
1560	0	I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign.
1561	0	"And other than - and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it's not a large amount."
1562	0	"No, I'm self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I've been in this business a long time and I was on the other side - until eight months ago I was on the or side."
1563	0	"I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans."
1564	0	"I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing."
1565	0	"I will say this - people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians."
1566	0	I don't want anybody to control me but the people right out there.
1567	0	And I'm going to do the right thing.
1568	0	(APPLAUSE)
1569	0	"Senator Cruz, I want to come to you."
1570	0	"The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns."
1571	0	Do you deny that those big donors do have influence?
1572	0	"Well look, absolutely."
1573	0	"And one of the things we're so frustrated about is the corruption, what I've called the Washington cartel."
1574	0	It's career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.
1575	0	"And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he's been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party."
1576	0	"And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change."
1577	0	But the interesting point is tonight he hasn't pointed to a single special interest he's willing to take on.
1578	0	He didn't take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street.
1579	0	He won't take on ethanol.
1580	0	"And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country."
1581	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1582	0	I want to go to Mr. Trump...
1583	0	$62 at tedcruz.org.
1584	0	... for a response.
1585	0	"Thank you, Senator."
1586	0	"That's who you've got to be accountable to, the people."
1587	0	Ted was given to PACs.
1588	0	"I mean, PACs - you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks."
1589	0	Very corrupt.
1590	0	It's going to lead to lots of disasters.
1591	0	"But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one."
1592	0	It's very important to do that.
1593	0	"There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived."
1594	0	"And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken."
1595	0	"And I'm the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I've always made large contributions."
1596	0	"And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong."
1597	0	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
1598	0	"Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question."
1599	0	"At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible."
1600	0	"With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren't willing to show flexibility?"
1601	0	"Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn't be flexible about your principles."
1602	0	"About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that."
1603	0	"Listen, on the issue of higher education, I'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt."
1604	0	So I know this is a major issue.
1605	0	And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.
1606	0	The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a - on a bipartisan basis.
1607	0	The sanctions that I helped - that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis.
1608	0	"The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis."
1609	0	But I also want to be frank.
1610	0	There are issues we're going to have to have an election over.
1611	0	"When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that's not going to be bipartisan."
1612	0	"When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that's not going to be bipartisan."
1613	0	"When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that's probably not going to be bipartisan."
1614	0	"There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government."
1615	0	"And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military."
1616	0	(APPLAUSE)
1617	0	All right.
1618	0	"Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence."
1619	0	What are some of the other issues on which you're willing to show flexibility?
1620	0	It depends on what comes up.
1621	0	You never know.
1622	0	It depends on what comes up.
1623	0	"Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan."
1624	0	"We had Tip O'Neill, speaker."
1625	0	"And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully."
1626	0	Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made.
1627	0	And he made it with Tip O'Neill.
1628	0	"We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint."
1629	0	"And I'll tell you this, it can be done."
1630	0	We don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind.
1631	0	"We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there's total, absolute gridlock."
1632	0	Thank you.
1633	0	"I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir."
1634	0	"Well, look, my record speaks for itself."
1635	0	What I talk about tonight is not a theory.
1636	0	These are things that I've done.
1637	0	I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together.
1638	0	"I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon."
1639	0	I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington.
1640	0	"And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare,"
1641	0	"I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor."
1642	0	My problem isn't that people don't know this.
1643	0	"They say, well, what does that mean?"
1644	0	Does that mean you're too easy?
1645	0	"Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government."
1646	0	"In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years."
1647	0	Conservative principles will work.
1648	0	But show respect to the other side.
1649	0	"One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone."
1650	0	We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security.
1651	0	I know how to do it because I've done it and I'll do it again.
1652	0	(APPLAUSE)
1653	0	"Thank you, Governor."
1654	0	We have time for one last break.
1655	0	We'll be right back after this.
1656	0	(APPLAUSE)
1657	0	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1658	0	"And we're back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections."
1659	0	It is time now for closing statements.
1660	0	"Candidates, you will each have one minute."
1661	0	And we'll start with Governor Kasich.
1662	0	"Well, I'd like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States."
1663	0	"I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision."
1664	0	And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.
1665	0	"Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign."
1666	0	"I can fix the problems in Washington, I've done it before."
1667	0	"And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty."
1668	0	We can do this together.
1669	0	Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families.
1670	0	That's where the spirit and strength of America is.
1671	0	"But ask the people - my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote."
1672	0	God bless.
1673	0	(APPLAUSE)
1674	0	Senator Rubio.
1675	0	"It's great to be here, back at home in Miami."
1676	0	"It's hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city."
1677	0	"And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land."
1678	0	My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else.
1679	0	They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves.
1680	0	And that was possible because America is a special country.
1681	0	But that was not an accident.
1682	0	America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done.
1683	0	"They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges."
1684	0	They embraced their opportunities.
1685	0	"And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off."
1686	0	And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part.
1687	0	"And I'm telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I'm elected president, this generation will do it's part."
1688	0	"We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind."
1689	0	(APPLAUSE)
1690	0	Senator Cruz.
1691	0	"What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support."
1692	0	"In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton."
1693	0	And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values?
1694	0	Who will best defend your values and fight for you?
1695	0	"I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, ""Madam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration.  You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future."""
1696	0	We can do better.
1697	0	"We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe."
1698	0	That's the choice I will put to her this fall.
1699	0	(APPLAUSE)
1700	0	Mr. Trump?
1701	0	Thank you very much.
1702	0	The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it's never known before.
1703	0	They're coming by the millions.
1704	0	We should seize that opportunity.
1705	0	These are great people.
1706	0	These are fantastic people.
1707	0	These are people that love our country.
1708	0	These are people that want to see America be great again.
1709	0	These are people that will win us the election and win it easily.
1710	0	These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job.
1711	0	"Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you're going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover."
1712	0	It will take centuries to recover.
1713	0	So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party.
1714	0	And unify.
1715	0	Be smart and unify.
1716	0	(APPLAUSE)
1717	0	And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate.
1718	0	"We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching."
1	0	"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:"
2	0	"Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams."
3	0	"That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action."
4	0	A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.
5	0	"Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission — to make America great again for all Americans."
6	0	(APPLAUSE)
7	0	"Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success."
8	0	"We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined."
9	0	We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.
10	0	We have endured floods and fires and storms.
11	0	"But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine."
12	0	"Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be."
13	0	"We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane."
14	0	We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.
15	0	"We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania."

183	0	"Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country."
184	0	This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing.
185	0	"For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us."
186	0	But now they are roaring back.

201	0	(APPLAUSE)
202	0	"In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States."

204	0	That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year.

219	0	America is a nation of builders.

224	0	(APPLAUSE)
225	0	"Tonight, I’m calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs."
226	0	"Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit."
227	0	And we can do it.
228	0	(APPLAUSE)

241	0	(APPLAUSE)
242	0	Let’s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.

244	0	And let’s support working families by supporting paid family leave.
245	0	(APPLAUSE)

248	0	(APPLAUSE)
249	0	"Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families."
250	0	"For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."
251	0	They’ve allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.
252	0	"Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives."
253	0	"Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens."
254	0	Their two teenage daughters — Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens — were close friends on Long Island.
255	0	"But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday — such a happy time it should have been — neither of them came home."
256	0	These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.
257	0	Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders.

259	0	"Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you."

261	0	Please stand.
262	0	Thank you very much.

269	0	"Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country."
270	0	"We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents — these are great people; these are great, great people — that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again."
271	0	(APPLAUSE)
272	0	The United States is a compassionate nation.
273	1	"We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world."

279	0	"My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream."
280	0	Because Americans are dreamers too.
281	0	(APPLAUSE)
282	0	"Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez."
283	0	"He goes by ""DJ"" and ""CJ."""
284	0	"He said, ""Call me either one."""
285	0	"So we’ll call you ""CJ."""
286	0	Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets.
287	0	Tough job.
288	0	"At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder."
289	0	And they wanted it to happen quickly.
290	0	But he did not cave to threats or to fear.
291	0	"Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island."
292	0	"His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members."
293	0	"And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done — we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons."
294	0	"So I just want to congratulate you, CJ."
295	0	You’re a brave guy.
296	0	Thank you very much.
297	0	(APPLAUSE)
298	0	"And I asked CJ, ""What’s the secret?"""

300	0	And I like that answer.
301	0	(LAUGHTER)
302	0	(APPLAUSE)

304	0	"CJ, we’re going to send you reinforcements, and we’re going to send them to you quickly."
305	0	It’s what you need.
306	0	(APPLAUSE)
307	0	"Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package."
308	0	"In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform."
309	0	"Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have."
310	0	(APPLAUSE)
311	0	Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age.
312	0	That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered.
313	0	(APPLAUSE)
314	0	"Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period."
315	0	(APPLAUSE)
316	0	The second pillar fully secures the border.
317	0	(APPLAUSE)
318	0	"That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe."
319	0	(APPLAUSE)
320	0	"Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release."
321	0	(APPLAUSE)
322	1	"The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people."
323	0	(APPLAUSE)
324	0	"It’s time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country."
325	0	(APPLAUSE)
326	0	The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.
327	0	(APPLAUSE)
328	0	"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives."
329	0	"Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children."
330	0	(APPLAUSE)
331	0	"This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America."
332	0	"In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration."
333	0	"In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford."
334	0	(APPLAUSE)
335	0	"It’s time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century."
336	0	(APPLAUSE)
337	0	"These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system."
338	0	"For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem."
339	0	This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.
340	0	"Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first."
341	0	(APPLAUSE)
342	0	"So let’s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done."
343	0	(APPLAUSE)
344	0	These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.
345	0	Never before has it been like it is now.
346	0	It is terrible.
347	0	We have to do something about it.
348	0	"In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses — 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour."
349	0	We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.
350	0	(APPLAUSE)
351	0	"My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt."
352	0	"The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do — in the end, we will succeed."
353	0	We will prevail.
354	0	(APPLAUSE)
355	0	"As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America."
356	0	We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.
357	0	"Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department."
358	0	He’s here tonight with his wife Rebecca.
359	0	(APPLAUSE)
360	0	"Thank you, Ryan."
361	0	"Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin."
362	0	"When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep."
363	0	"She told him she didn’t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby."
364	0	"In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: ""You will do it, because you can."""
365	0	He heard those words.
366	0	He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.
367	0	"Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca."
368	0	"In an instant, she agreed to adopt."
369	0	The Holets named their new daughter Hope.
370	0	"Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation."
371	0	Thank you.
372	0	(APPLAUSE)
373	0	"Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca."
374	1	"As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad."
375	0	"Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values."
376	0	"In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense."
377	0	"For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military."
378	0	(APPLAUSE)
379	0	"As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else."
380	0	(APPLAUSE)
381	0	"Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons."
382	0	"Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly."
383	0	"Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth."
384	0	"One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well."
385	0	(APPLAUSE)
386	0	But there is much more work to be done.
387	0	We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.
388	0	Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.
389	0	"Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely."
390	0	"Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion."
391	0	"Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape."
392	0	He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.
393	0	"He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery."
394	0	Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin’s selfless love for his fellow warrior.
395	0	"Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas."
396	0	Raqqa is liberated.
397	0	"And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a ""V"" for ""valor."""
398	0	"Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you."
399	0	(APPLAUSE)
400	0	Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.
401	0	"When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them."
402	0	"When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them."
403	0	But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals.
404	0	They are unlawful enemy combatants.
405	0	(APPLAUSE)
406	0	"And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are."
407	0	"In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released."
408	0	"So today, I’m keeping another promise."
409	0	"I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you —"
410	0	(APPLAUSE)
411	0	— to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.
412	0	(APPLAUSE)
413	0	"I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them."
414	0	"And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay."
415	0	(APPLAUSE)
416	0	"At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement."
417	0	(APPLAUSE)

422	0	I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
423	0	(APPLAUSE)
424	0	"Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this decision."
425	0	"In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid."
426	0	"That is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America."
427	0	(APPLAUSE)
428	0	"As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries."
429	0	"When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent."
430	0	America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.
431	0	(APPLAUSE)
432	0	I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.
433	0	My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.
434	0	(APPLAUSE)
435	0	But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.
436	0	North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.
437	0	We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.
438	0	Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.
439	0	I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.
440	0	We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.
441	0	Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia — and a great student he was.
442	0	"On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea."
443	0	"At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state."
444	0	"After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death."
445	0	He passed away just days after his return.
446	0	"Otto’s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta."
447	0	Please.
448	0	(APPLAUSE)
449	0	Incredible people.
450	0	"You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all."
451	0	Thank you very much.
452	0	Thank you.
453	0	(APPLAUSE)
454	0	"Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with total American resolve."
455	0	Thank you.
456	0	(APPLAUSE)
457	0	"Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime."
458	0	His name is Mr.
459	0	Ji Seong-ho.
460	0	"In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea."
461	0	"One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get."
462	0	"In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger."
463	0	He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.
464	0	He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt.
465	0	"His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth."
466	0	"Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China."
467	0	His tormentors wanted to know if he’d met any Christians.
468	0	"He had — and he resolved, after that, to be free."
469	0	Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.
470	0	Most of his family followed.
471	0	His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.
472	0	"Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth."
473	0	"Today, he has a new leg."
474	0	"But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you’ve come."
475	0	Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.
476	0	Please.
477	0	Thank you.
478	0	(APPLAUSE)
479	0	Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.
480	0	It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.
481	0	It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.
482	0	"It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world."
483	0	That is what our country has always been about.
484	0	"That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done."
485	0	Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.
486	0	"She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her."
487	0	"Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King."
488	0	"Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia."
489	0	And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one.
490	0	This Capitol — this living monument — this is the moment to the American people.
491	0	(APPLAUSE)
492	0	USA!
493	0	USA!
494	0	USA!
495	0	"We’re a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way."
496	0	They work in every trade.
497	0	They sacrifice to raise a family.
498	0	They care for our children at home.
499	0	They defend our flag abroad.
500	0	And they are strong moms and brave kids.
501	0	"They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines."
502	0	"But above all else, they are Americans."
503	0	"And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them."
504	0	(APPLAUSE)
505	0	"Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them."
506	0	Americans fill the world with art and music.
507	0	They push the bounds of science and discovery.
508	0	"And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country."
509	0	The people built this country.
510	0	And it’s the people who are making America great again.
511	0	(APPLAUSE)
512	0	"As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve."
513	0	"As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail."
514	0	Our families will thrive.
515	0	Our people will prosper.
516	0	And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.
517	0	Thank you.
518	0	And God bless America.
519	0	Good night.

1	0	STAHL Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?
2	0	I think something's happening.
3	0	Something's changing and it'll change back again.
4	0	"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."
5	0	But I don't know that it's manmade.
6	0	I will say this.
7	0	I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.
8	0	I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs.
9	0	I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.
10	0	STAHL "I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels."
11	0	And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.
12	0	You don't know.
13	0	STAHL "Well, your scientists, your scientists--"
14	0	"No, we have--"
15	0	STAHL At NOAA and NASA--
16	0	We have scientists that disagree with that.
17	0	STAHL "You know, I was thinking what if he said, ""No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change."""
18	0	STAHL "And I thought, ""Wow, what an impact."""
19	0	Well-- I'm not denying.
20	0	STAHL What an impact that would make.
21	0	I'm not denying climate change.
22	0	But it could very well go back.
23	0	"You know, we're talkin' about over a millions--"
24	0	STAHL But that's denying it.
25	0	NAME?
26	0	They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.
27	0	STAHL Who says that?
28	0	STAHL They say?
29	0	People say.
30	0	People say that in the--
31	0	STAHL "Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?"
32	0	"You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley."
33	0	STAHL I can't bring them in.
34	0	"Look, scientists also have a political agenda."
35	0	STAHL "Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist--"
36	0	Yes.
37	0	Yes.
38	0	STAHL "--the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis?"
39	0	STAHL And did the prince give the order to kill him?
40	0	"Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out."
41	0	It's being investigated.
42	0	"It's being looked at very, very strongly."
43	0	And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.
44	0	"As of this moment, they deny it."
45	0	And den-- deny it vehemently.
46	0	Could it be them?
47	0	Yes.
48	0	STAHL "Jared, your son-in-law."
49	0	STAHL Got on the phone and asked the prince.
50	0	STAHL Did he deny it?
51	0	STAHL Did he--
52	0	They deny it.
53	0	They deny it every way you can imagine.
54	0	"In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer."
55	0	STAHL What are you options?
56	0	STAHL Let's say they did.
57	0	STAHL What are your options?
58	0	STAHL "Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?"
59	0	"Well, it depends on what the sanction is."
60	0	I'll give ya an example.
61	0	They are ordering military equipment.
62	0	Everybody in the world wanted that order.
63	0	"Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it."
64	0	We got it.
65	0	STAHL So would you cut that off--
66	0	I tell you what I don't wanna do.
67	0	"Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com-- I don't wanna hurt jobs."
68	0	I don't wanna lose an order like that.
69	0	"There are other ways of-- punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true."
70	0	STAHL Tell everybody what's at stake here.
71	0	STAHL You know---
72	0	"Well, there's a lot at stake."
73	0	There's a lot at stake.
74	0	And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter.
75	0	There's something-- you'll be surprised to hear me say that.
76	0	"There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case."
77	0	So we're gonna have to see.
78	0	We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.
79	0	STAHL You've had a string of wins lately.
80	0	STAHL "Let's see, the economy, the d-- the trade deal-"
81	0	Right.
82	0	STAHL "With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh--"
83	0	And South Korea.
84	0	STAHL And South Korea.
85	0	STAHL "And Kavanaugh, the confirmation."
86	0	"There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years--"
87	0	STAHL "Say, this is modesty."
88	0	"Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history."
89	0	STAHL What about North Korea?
90	0	STAHL Talking about accom--
91	0	"Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement."
92	0	"Look, we--"
93	0	STAHL "You say ""so far""?"
94	0	"It's always so far, til everything's done."
95	0	"I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay?"
96	0	"Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter."
97	0	But I will say this.
98	0	"The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea."
99	0	I sat with President Obama--
100	0	STAHL We were goin' to war?
101	0	NAME?
102	0	"And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get."
103	0	Doesn't get any tougher than that.
104	0	Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.
105	0	We were going to war with North Korea.
106	0	"Now, you don't hear that."
107	0	You don't hear any talk of it.
108	1	"And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it."
109	1	"And you see that, he's agreed to it."
110	0	No missiles.
111	0	STAHL Do you trust him?
112	0	"I do trust him, yeah, I trust him."
113	0	That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --
114	0	STAHL Why would--
115	0	about it?
116	0	STAHL you trust him?
117	0	"Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you."
118	0	"Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--"
119	0	STAHL "Well, remember what Reagan said."
120	0	STAHL "Trust, but verify."
121	0	Sure.
122	0	I know.
123	0	It's-- it's very true.
124	0	"But the fact is, I do trust him."
125	0	But we'll see what happens.
126	0	STAHL "But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-"
127	0	They want to--
128	0	STAHL With nuclear--
129	0	And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.
130	0	STAHL But--
131	0	Setting it up.
132	0	STAHL "Is what I said true, that they haven't?"
133	0	STAHL Gotten--
134	0	"Well, nobody really knows."
135	0	"I mean, people are saying that."
136	0	I've actually said that.
137	0	STAHL What?
138	0	STAHL "That they're still building missiles, more missiles?"
139	0	"We don't really know, Lesley."
140	0	We really don't know.
141	0	But I assume--
142	0	STAHL Suspect that?
143	0	"Let's say the answer is yes, okay?"
144	0	"In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile."
145	0	They haven't tested a rocket.
146	0	They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.
147	0	It sort of moves the earth.
148	0	And we have a relationship now.
149	0	STAHL One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.
150	0	We haven't done that.
151	0	STAHL Are you prepared to do that?
152	0	STAHL What-- what does he have to do--
153	0	"No, no."
154	0	I--
155	0	STAHL Before you're--
156	0	No I'm not doing it.
157	0	This isn't the Obama administration.
158	0	I haven't eased the sanctions.
159	0	I haven't done anything.
160	0	I haven't done anything.
161	0	We're meeting.
162	0	I believe he likes me.
163	0	I like him.
164	0	We have a good relationship.
165	0	It's very important.
166	0	STAHL "I wanna read you his resume, okay?"
167	0	STAHL "He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation-- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions."
168	0	STAHL This is a guy you love?
169	0	Sure.
170	0	I know all these things.
171	0	I mean-- I'm not a baby.
172	0	I know these things.
173	0	STAHL "I know, but why do you love that guy?"
174	0	"Look, look."
175	0	"I-- I-- I like-- I get along with him, okay?"
176	0	STAHL But you love him.
177	0	Okay.
178	0	That's just a figure of speech.
179	0	STAHL "No, it's like an embrace."
180	0	"It well, let it be an embrace."
181	0	Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.
182	0	STAHL He's a bad guy.
183	0	Look.
184	0	Let it be whatever it is.
185	0	I get along with him really well.
186	0	I have a good energy with him.
187	0	I have a good chemistry with him.
188	0	Look at the horrible threats that were made.
189	0	No more threats.
190	0	No more threats.
191	0	STAHL China.
192	0	I get along with him.
193	0	It's very important.
194	0	"China, let's go."
195	0	STAHL I'm skipping across the world here.
196	0	STAHL You've slapped a lot of tariffs--
197	0	$250 billion.
198	0	STAHL Gonna do more?
199	0	Might.
200	0	Might.
201	0	STAHL Round three?

203	0	They wanna negotiate.
204	0	STAHL Are you ready?
205	0	Look.
206	0	STAHL Are you ready to--
207	0	I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China.
208	0	I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue.
209	1	I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.
210	0	STAHL And how-- how--
211	0	"And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore."
212	0	STAHL How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?
213	0	Okay.
214	0	Okay.
215	0	"So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case."
216	0	STAHL Some--
217	0	"--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%."
218	0	STAHL But they've--
219	0	NAME?
220	0	STAHL NAME?
221	0	STAHL That's what I'm asking.
222	0	"They can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate."
223	0	We do $100 billion with them.
224	1	They do $531 billion with us.
225	0	STAHL Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?
226	0	"No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929."
227	0	STAHL Well that's what I'm asking.
228	0	I don't want that.
229	0	"No, I don't want that."
230	0	I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.
231	0	I want them to open their markets like our-- our markets are open.
232	0	STAHL But you're in a--
233	0	And it will be a fair deal--
234	0	STAHL NAME?
235	0	STAHL Trade war.
236	0	"You call it war, I don't call--"
237	0	STAHL You-- you--
238	0	--it--
239	0	STAHL NAME?
240	0	I called it a skirmish.
241	0	STAHL "I heard you, you called it a war."
242	0	"I called it, actually I called it a battle."
243	0	"But, actually, I'm gonna lower that."
244	0	I consider it a skirmish.
245	0	And we're gonna win.
246	0	STAHL You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.
247	0	"I mean, what's an ally?"
248	0	We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.
249	0	But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.
250	0	"The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done."
251	0	STAHL But this is hostile.
252	0	"And yet, they-- it's not hostile."
253	0	STAHL It sounds hostile.
254	0	You know what's hostile?
255	0	The way they treat us.
256	0	We're not hostile.
257	0	STAHL "No, but can't you deal with--"
258	0	We've been-- we've been--
259	0	STAHL --them without--
260	0	NAME?
261	0	STAHL Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?
262	0	"Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine."
263	0	But you know what?
264	1	We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.
265	0	"And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade."
266	0	They're not going to do it anymore.
267	0	They understand that.
268	0	STAHL "Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?"
269	0	STAHL It's been going for 70 years.
270	0	STAHL It's kept the peace for 70 years.
271	0	You don't know that.
272	0	You don't know that.
273	0	STAHL I don't know what?
274	0	You don't know that.
275	0	STAHL "Is it true General Mattis said to you, ""The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"""
276	0	"No, it's not true."
277	0	STAHL What's not true?
278	0	"Frankly, I like General Mattis."
279	0	I think I know more about it than he does.
280	0	"And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you."
281	0	STAHL I'm gonna try one more time.
282	0	STAHL Okay.
283	0	"I know-- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again."
284	0	I know exactly what you're saying--
285	0	STAHL "Well, answer my question."
286	0	The answer is this.
287	0	"I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way."
288	0	"I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of."
289	0	STAHL Putin.
290	0	Yeah.
291	0	STAHL "Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin."
292	0	"Okay, you ready?"
293	0	STAHL I don't understand it.
294	0	I have been-- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference--
295	0	STAHL "No, I mean publicly."
296	0	STAHL You never say anything harsh about him--
297	0	Excuse me.
298	0	STAHL NAME?
299	0	I didn't?
300	0	I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.
301	0	Obama didn't.
302	0	You know what he sent?
303	0	He sent pillows and blankets.
304	0	I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--
305	0	STAHL "Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin--"
306	0	I think I'm very tough with him personally.
307	0	I had a meeting with him.
308	0	The two of us.
309	0	It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.
310	0	STAHL Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?
311	0	STAHL In poisonings?
312	0	"Probably he is, yeah."
313	0	Probably.
314	0	"I mean, I don't--"
315	0	STAHL Probably?
316	0	"But I rely on them, it's not in our country."
317	0	STAHL Why not-- they shouldn't do it.
318	0	STAHL This is a terrible thing.
319	0	Of course they shouldn't do it-
320	0	STAHL Instead do you believe--
321	0	That's your (Inaudible.)--
322	0	STAHL --do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?
323	0	STAHL Our election-
324	1	They-- they meddled.
325	0	But I think China meddled too.
326	0	STAHL But why do you--
327	0	And I think other countries--
328	0	STAHL NAME?
329	0	And you wanna know something?
330	0	STAHL Why do you say Chi-- why don't you just say--
331	0	"Well, let me ask you--"
332	0	STAHL NAME?
333	0	Because I think China meddled also.
334	0	"And I think, frankly, China--"
335	0	STAHL This is amazing.
336	0	NAME?
337	0	STAHL You are diverting the whole Russia thing.
338	0	I'm not doing anything.
339	0	STAHL "You are, you are"
340	1	"I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China."
341	0	STAHL "What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?"
342	0	"Well, we'll see what happens come midterms."
343	0	But--
344	0	STAHL "But everybody thinks, given the things you've said--"
345	0	I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.
346	0	I was very disappointed.
347	0	Why should he have recused himself?
348	0	So I was very--
349	0	STAHL So--
350	0	--disappointed but--
351	0	STAHL So can I assume--
352	0	--we'll see what happens.
353	0	STAHL Can I assume he's gone?
354	0	No.
355	0	No.
356	0	You can't assume that.
357	0	STAHL Will you.
358	0	STAHL Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?
359	0	"Well, I-- I don't pledge anything."
360	0	"But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that."
361	0	I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.
362	0	STAHL But you won't pledge--
363	0	There is no collusion.
364	0	I don't wanna pledge.
365	0	Why should I pledge to you?
366	0	"If I pledge, I'll pledge."
367	0	I don't have to pledge to you.
368	0	But I have-
369	0	STAHL Well--
370	0	I have no intention of doing that.
371	0	Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?
372	0	Give me a break.
373	1	They wouldn't be able to help me at all.
374	0	Call Russia.
375	0	It's so ridiculous.
376	0	STAHL So you've been president for almost two years.
377	0	STAHL "Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?"
378	0	STAHL Do you have any regrets?
379	0	"So when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly."
380	0	"I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great."
381	0	"Lesley, they treat me worse."
382	0	They got worse instead of better.
383	0	Very dishonest.
384	0	STAHL "Okay, this-- you're-- but you regret?"
385	0	I regret that the press treats me so badly--
386	0	STAHL I'm-- I'm really asking (Inaudible.)--
387	0	"And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so."
388	0	STAHL Have you made any mistakes?
389	0	STAHL That's my question.
390	0	Everybody makes mistakes.
391	0	STAHL And what have been yours?
392	0	I could have been-- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.
393	0	"The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders."
394	0	I was getting to know countries.
395	0	I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.
396	0	"So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier."
397	0	STAHL What about the forced separation of children from their-- migrant children--
398	0	Yeah.
399	0	"Well, that was--"
400	0	STAHL from the--
401	1	the same as the Obama law.
402	1	"You know, Obama had the same thing."
403	0	STAHL "It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it."
404	0	STAHL You--enforced it.
405	0	STAHL You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--
406	0	"No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation."
407	0	"And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country."
408	0	STAHL So are you gonna go back to that?
409	0	"Well, we're looking at a lot of things."
410	0	"Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world."
411	0	STAHL Are you willing though-- I think that you're saying you're-- it's under consideration.
412	0	"No, I want all the laws changed."
413	0	STAHL But the children specifically--
414	0	"there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally."
415	0	"And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States."
416	0	STAHL "Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no."
417	0	Go ahead.
418	0	STAHL Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?
419	0	STAHL "You said, ""We're looking at everything."""
420	0	I will--
421	0	STAHL Yes or no.
422	0	I will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no.
423	0	"What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally."
424	0	STAHL I'm not gonna ask it again--
425	0	You don't have to.
426	0	STAHL cause I know you won't-- it--
427	1	But it's the same as Obama.
428	0	STAHL Okay.
429	0	STAHL "Changing subjects again-- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military."
430	0	STAHL "You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?"
431	0	Okay.
432	0	"So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah."
433	0	Now I say they're babies.
434	0	STAHL Who's the toughest?
435	0	"They're babies, the political people."
436	0	"This is the most deceptive, vicious world."
437	0	"It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception."
438	0	You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.
439	0	STAHL Give me an example.
440	0	"Well, I don't wanna give you an example."
441	0	"I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do."
442	0	Remember that.
443	0	"When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries."
444	0	Nobody's been able to do anything like this.
445	0	"Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it."
446	0	But it's a very deceptive world.
447	0	The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.
448	0	I-- I-- and I really mean it.
449	0	I'm not saying that as a sound bite.
450	0	I never--
451	0	STAHL I'd like to--
452	0	Knew how dishonest--
453	0	STAHL I'm-- I'm gonna change the subject again.
454	0	"Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation."
455	0	"When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it."
456	0	STAHL "No, I'm gonna run your--"
457	0	"When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it."
458	0	STAHL "I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so."
459	0	I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.
460	0	STAHL "I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you."
461	0	"Hey, it's okay--"
462	0	STAHL "All right, I'll get in another fight with you--"
463	0	"Lesley, it's okay."
464	0	"In the meantime, I'm president--and you're not."
465	0	STAHL "This country is divided, polarized."
466	0	STAHL "Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other."
467	0	STAHL "What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and--"
468	0	Yeah-- I think that--
469	0	STAHL NAME?
470	0	--what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together.
471	0	"It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama."
472	0	I can see the country uniting.
473	0	I can see it.
474	0	"We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh-- you-- know what I'm saying."
475	0	STAHL But when you won that.
476	0	"--during the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly."
477	0	STAHL "But when you won, you won."
478	0	STAHL No-- no one is gonna argue with that.
479	0	I won--
480	0	STAHL You won.
481	0	STAHL "And then after you won, instead of saying, ""Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful."
482	0	STAHL "Let's heal all of this,"" you come out and bash the Democrats."
483	0	"Well, I bashed their attitude."
484	0	I bashed their statements--
485	0	STAHL But why not try to--
486	0	Because they were--
487	0	STAHL NAME?
488	0	NAME?
489	0	I've never--
490	0	STAHL But why not--
491	0	seen anything like it.
492	0	STAHL NAME?
493	0	STAHL We need--
494	0	"I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest."
495	0	STAHL "Well, you don't wanna--"
496	0	I think--
497	0	STAHL heal yet.
498	0	I-- I-- I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement.
499	0	I don't think they wanna be healed.
500	0	I do wanna heal.
501	0	STAHL I'm n-- I'm not talking about Democrat-- I'm talking about the country.
502	0	STAHL You go out and you go to Mississippi.
503	0	The famous Mississippi speech?
504	0	STAHL And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford.
505	0	STAHL You mimicked her.
506	0	"Had I not made that speech, we would not have won."
507	0	I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.
508	0	STAHL No (Inaudible.)--
509	0	And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.
510	0	STAHL Why did you have to make fun of her?
511	0	I didn't really make fun of her.
512	0	STAHL "Well, they were laughing."
513	1	"What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place."
514	0	STAHL Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and-- and was asked what's the worst moment.
515	0	STAHL "And she said, ""When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."""
516	0	"Ok, fine."
517	0	STAHL And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.
518	0	They can do what they-- I-- I will tell you this.
519	0	The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms.
520	0	Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?
521	0	STAHL But did you have to--
522	0	"Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll-- I'll--"
523	0	STAHL And-- but--
524	0	be honest with you.
525	0	STAHL but do you think—you treated her with--
526	0	There are those that think she shouldn't have--
527	0	STAHL Do you think you treated her with respect?
528	0	"I think so, yeah."
529	0	I did.
530	0	STAHL But you seem to be saying that she lied.
531	0	W-- you know what?
532	0	I'm not gonna get into it because we won.
533	0	It doesn't matter.
534	0	We won.
535	0	STAHL "The anonymous column that ran in ""The New York Times."""
536	0	STAHL "The author, we don't know who it is."
537	0	STAHL Whoever it is.
538	0	Whoever it is.
539	0	"Maybe it was ""The New York Times"" too."
540	0	STAHL Paints a picture.
541	0	"No, no, it's --By the way, you don't know how dishonest ""The New York Times"" is."
542	0	"It could've been ""The New York Times."""
543	0	I doubt it.
544	0	But it could've been.
545	0	STAHL Okay.
546	0	STAHL I doubt it too.
547	0	"It also could've been any-- w-- well, don't count on it."
548	0	"It also could've been any one of 3,000 people."
549	0	STAHL You have said that this administration is like a smooth-running machine.
550	0	STAHL "And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos."
551	0	"It's-- wrong, it's so false."
552	0	It's fake news.
553	0	I'm changing things around.
554	0	And I'm entitled to.
555	0	I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal.
556	0	"They'll come into the administration, they'll be phenomenal."
557	0	STAHL More people gonna go?
558	0	"Yeah, other people will go, sure."
559	0	STAHL "Cause so many people, you have kind of a record of --on turnover."
560	0	I think I have a great Cabinet.
561	0	There're some people that I'm not happy with.
562	0	STAHL Who are you not happy with?
563	0	"No, I don't wanna say that but"
564	0	STAHL Come on.
565	0	Not I don't want to say that.
566	0	STAHL What about General Mattis?
567	0	STAHL Is he going to leave?
568	0	"Well, I don't know."
569	0	He hasn't told me that.
570	0	I have--
571	0	STAHL Do you want him to--
572	0	NAME?
573	0	It could be that he is.
574	0	"I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth."
575	0	But General Mattis is a good guy.
576	0	We get along very well.
577	0	He may leave.
578	0	"I mean, at some point, everybody leaves."
579	0	Everybody.
580	0	People leave.
581	0	That's Washington.
582	0	STAHL "The first lady, Melania."
583	0	STAHL She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust.
584	0	I feel the same way.
585	0	"I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you."
586	0	STAHL "You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, ""Is he wearing a wire--"""
587	0	I'm usually --
588	0	STAHL –or whatever?
589	0	Not so much a wire.
590	0	I'm usually guarded.
591	0	And I think I'm guarded anyway.
592	0	But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House.
593	0	I'm not a baby.
594	0	It's a tough business.
595	0	This is a r-- this is a vicious place.
596	0	"Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place."
597	0	"The attacks, the-- the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back."
598	0	"--but-- you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here."
599	0	STAHL It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.
600	0	I think so.
601	0	"I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody."
602	0	STAHL POTUS.
603	0	Now I very much feel like POTUS.
604	0	I do.
605	0	I feel like the president.
606	0	"You know, for a little while, it's like-- ""Mr. President, sir."""
607	0	"It's-- even my friends, they call me, they-- they don't call me Donald-- they call me Mr. President."
608	0	"And I say, ""Will you please loosen up?"""
609	0	I've learned on the job.
610	0	I have.
611	0	STAHL And you feel comfortable?

100	0	It just doesn’t work that way.
101	0	We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.
102	0	This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate.
103	0	"In some cases, years and years waiting."
104	0	Not right.

109	1	"In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms."

119	0	"She had a big impact on that prison population, and far beyond."
120	0	"Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing, and the need to remedy this total injustice."

133	0	Big deal.
134	0	(APPLAUSE)
135	0	It’s a big deal.
136	0	This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.
137	0	"The FIRST STEP Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens."
138	0	Now states across the country are following our lead.
139	0	America is a nation that believes in redemption.
140	0	We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.
141	0	"In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses."
142	0	"Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates."

150	0	"Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border."
151	0	"Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
152	0	(APPLAUSE)
153	0	"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States."
154	0	"We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection."
155	0	"I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught."
156	0	This is a moral issue.
157	0	"The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial wellbeing of all America."
158	0	We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.
159	0	This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws.
160	0	Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.
161	0	(APPLAUSE)
162	0	"I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally."
163	0	(APPLAUSE)
164	0	"Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country."
165	0	No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.
166	0	"Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, and gates, and guards."
167	0	(APPLAUSE)
168	0	"Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
169	0	Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel.
170	0	(APPLAUSE)
171	0	One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.
172	0	Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
173	1	Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
174	1	"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
175	0	"The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border."
176	0	"Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City."
177	0	We are removing these gang members by the thousands.
178	0	"But until we secure our border, they’re going to keep streaming right back in."
179	1	"Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens."
180	0	"I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads, and families."
181	0	No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.
182	0	Here tonight is Debra Bissell.
183	0	"Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien."
184	0	"They were in their eighties, and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren."
185	0	"Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison."
186	0	"To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand."
187	0	Few can understand your pain.
188	0	Thank you.
189	0	And thank you for being here.
190	0	Thank you very much.
191	0	(APPLAUSE)
192	0	"I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again."
193	0	Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
194	0	"In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders."
195	0	We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.
196	0	When Elvin —
197	0	(APPLAUSE)
198	0	— thank you.
199	0	"When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic."
200	0	"At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent."
201	0	"Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking."
202	0	"Elvin says that, ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve [really] done my job."""
203	0	"Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars."
204	0	(APPLAUSE)
205	0	"Thank you, Elvin."
206	0	"We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE."
207	0	Thank you.
208	0	(APPLAUSE)
209	0	My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border.
210	0	"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry."
211	0	"In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built."
212	0	I will get it built.
213	0	(APPLAUSE)
214	0	"This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall."
215	0	It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need.
216	1	"And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down."
217	0	(APPLAUSE)
218	1	San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country.
219	0	"In response, a strong security wall was put in place."
220	1	This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
221	1	"The border city of El Paso, Texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities."
222	1	"Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."
223	1	"Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives."
224	0	(APPLAUSE)
225	0	"So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
226	0	"As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace."
227	0	"No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year."
228	0	(APPLAUSE)
229	0	You weren’t supposed to do that.
230	0	Thank you very much.
231	0	Thank you very much.
232	1	All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.
233	0	(APPLAUSE)
234	0	Don’t sit yet.
235	0	You’re going to like this.
236	0	(LAUGHTER)
237	0	"And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before."
238	0	(APPLAUSE)
239	0	USA!
240	0	USA!
241	0	USA!
242	0	That’s great.
243	0	Really great.
244	0	And congratulations.
245	0	That’s great.
246	0	"As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries."
247	0	To build on —
248	0	(APPLAUSE)
249	0	— thank you.
250	0	"To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
251	0	So bad.
252	0	"We are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end."
253	0	(APPLAUSE)
254	0	"Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars."
255	0	But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.
256	0	"I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China."
257	0	"But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs."
258	0	(APPLAUSE)
259	0	Thank you.
260	0	Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
261	0	"I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA."
262	0	"For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now."
263	0	"Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven’t had delivered to for a long time."
264	0	"I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: ""Made in the USA."""
265	0	(APPLAUSE)
266	0	"Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us."
267	0	(APPLAUSE)
268	0	Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.
269	0	(APPLAUSE)
270	0	"I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future."
271	0	This is not an option.
272	0	This is a necessity.
273	0	"The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and to protect patients with preexisting conditions."
274	0	(APPLAUSE)
275	0	"Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years."
276	0	(APPLAUSE)
277	0	But we must do more.
278	0	"It’s unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place."
279	0	"This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it — and we’ll stop it fast."
280	0	(APPLAUSE)
281	0	"I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally."
282	0	(APPLAUSE)
283	0	"We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down."
284	0	(APPLAUSE)
285	0	No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.
286	0	In recent years —
287	0	(APPLAUSE)
288	0	"— in recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS."
289	0	Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.
290	0	My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.
291	0	We have made incredible strides.
292	0	Incredible.

299	0	Every birthday —

301	0	"— hi, Grace."
302	0	(LAUGHTER)
303	0	"Every birthday since she was four, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital."
304	0	She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.
305	0	That’s what happened.
306	0	"Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer."
307	0	"Immediately, she began radiation treatment."
308	0	"At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer."
309	0	(APPLAUSE)
310	0	"When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered — they loved her; they still love her — with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of chemo."""

320	0	(APPLAUSE)
321	0	There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
322	1	Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.
323	0	"These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world."
324	0	"And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth."
325	0	"To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb."
326	0	(APPLAUSE)
327	0	Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.
328	0	(APPLAUSE)
329	0	And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
330	0	The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.
331	0	"Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year."
332	0	We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.
333	0	(APPLAUSE)
334	0	Finally.
335	0	Finally.
336	0	"For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO."
337	0	"But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies."
338	0	(APPLAUSE)
339	0	They said it couldn’t be done.
340	0	"As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system."
341	0	"Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests."
342	0	"For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability."
343	0	"While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms."
344	0	It’s been going on for many years.
345	0	"That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty."
346	0	Perhaps —
347	0	(APPLAUSE)
348	0	— we really have no choice.
349	0	"Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far."
350	0	(APPLAUSE)

360	0	"— and its new President, Juan Guaidó."
361	0	(APPLAUSE)

376	0	USA!
377	0	USA!
378	0	"One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East."
379	0	"Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress."
380	0	"For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel, and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."
381	0	(APPLAUSE)
382	0	Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.
383	0	"In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives."
384	0	"More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded."
385	0	We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.
386	0	"As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach."
387	0	Great nations do not fight endless wars.
388	0	(APPLAUSE)
389	1	"When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria — just two years ago."
390	1	"Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters."
391	0	"Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."
392	0	I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach — if possible — a political settlement in Afghanistan.
393	0	The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating.
394	0	Our troops have fought with unmatched valor.
395	0	"And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict."
396	0	(APPLAUSE)
397	0	"In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban."
398	0	"As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop’s presence and focus on counterterrorism."
399	0	And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.
400	0	"We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace."
401	0	And the other side would like to do the same thing.
402	0	It’s time.
403	0	(APPLAUSE)

412	0	My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.
413	0	It is a radical regime.
414	0	"They do bad, bad things."
415	0	"To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal."
416	0	(APPLAUSE)
417	0	"And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country."

423	0	SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.
424	0	And he was very successful.
425	0	"Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more."
426	0	But he made the trip to be here with us tonight.

429	0	Thank you.
430	0	We are forever grateful.
431	0	Thank you very much.
432	0	"Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet."
433	0	He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.
434	0	"But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps."
435	0	Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.

437	0	"(Sings ""Happy Birthday."")"
438	0	(APPLAUSE)
439	0	Thank you!
440	0	"They wouldn’t do that for me, Judah."
441	0	(LAUGHTER)
442	0	"Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp."
443	0	"Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt."
444	0	A soldier appeared.
445	0	Judah’s family braced for the absolute worst.
446	0	"Then, his father cried out with joy, ""It’s the Americans! It’s the Americans!"""
447	0	(APPLAUSE)
448	0	Thank you.
449	0	"A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau."
450	0	He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.
451	0	"To me, Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."""
452	0	They came down from Heaven.
453	0	I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War.
454	0	One of them was Herman Zeitchik.
455	0	But there is more to Herman’s story.
456	0	"A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau."
457	0	(APPLAUSE)
458	0	He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.
459	0	"Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom."
460	0	"Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated."
461	0	Thank you very much.
462	0	(APPLAUSE)
463	0	Thank you.
464	0	"When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war."
465	0	They did not know if they would survive the hour.
466	0	They did not know if they would grow old.
467	0	But they knew that America had to prevail.
468	0	Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn.
469	0	Why did they do it?
470	0	They did it for America.
471	0	They did it for us.
472	0	"Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before."
473	0	Think of this Capitol.
474	0	"Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires."
475	0	"Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic."
476	0	You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.
477	0	"Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history."
478	0	What will we do with this moment?
479	0	How will we be remembered?
480	0	I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us.
481	0	Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.
482	0	Our most exciting journeys still await.
483	0	Our biggest victories are still to come.
484	0	We have not yet begun to dream.
485	0	We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.
486	0	We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.
487	0	We do the incredible.
488	0	We defy the impossible.
489	0	We conquer the unknown.
490	0	This is the time to reignite the American imagination.
491	0	This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.
492	0	"This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots."
493	0	"This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make."
494	0	I am asking you to choose greatness.
495	0	"No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together."
496	0	We must keep America first in our hearts.
497	0	We must keep freedom alive in our souls.
498	0	"And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise, and the light and the glory, among all the nations of the world."
499	0	Thank you.
500	0	God bless you.
501	0	And God bless America.
502	0	Thank you very much.
503	0	Thank you.
504	0	(APPLAUSE)
1	0	"Thank you very much, everybody."
2	0	"Before we begin, I’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China."
3	0	We’ve had a negotiation going on for about two days.
4	0	It’s going extremely well.
5	0	"Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done."
6	0	"But we’re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot."
7	0	Very good relationship that we have.
8	0	And we’re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.
9	0	"We’re covering everything — all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn’t be done, whether it was theft or anything."
10	0	Anything.
11	0	The unfairness.
12	1	"We’ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China."
13	0	A lot of people think it’s $506 billion.
14	0	Some people think it’s much more than that.
15	0	We’re going to be leveling the playing field.
16	0	The tariffs are hurting China very badly.
17	0	They don’t want them.
18	0	"And frankly, if we can make the deal, it’d be my honor to remove them."
19	0	"But otherwise, we’re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury."
20	0	We’ve never had that before with China.
21	0	It’s been very much of a one-way street.
22	0	"So, that’s happening."
23	0	"And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country."
24	0	They haven’t respected us for a long time.
25	0	Not for a long time.
26	0	"The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we’re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement."
27	0	"You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems."
28	0	"But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that’s just been strengthened further."
29	0	"So with the UK, we’re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by."
30	0	"We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States."
31	0	"The relationship there, also, is very good."
32	0	We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.
33	0	And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.
34	0	And many other things.
35	0	A lot of positive things are going on.
36	0	We’re working on a summit.
37	0	And you know all about the summit.
38	0	It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.
39	0	And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.
40	0	We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.
41	0	"I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect."
42	0	And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.
43	0	A lot was done in the first summit.
44	0	No more rockets going up.
45	0	No more missiles going up.
46	0	No more testing of nuclear.
47	0	"Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War."
48	0	And we got back our hostages.
49	0	But we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.
50	0	I’m in no rush for speed.
51	0	We just don’t want testing.
52	0	"The sanctions, as you know, remain."
53	0	Everything is remaining.
54	0	"China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us."
55	0	"And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan."
56	0	"But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing."
57	0	And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.
58	0	"So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one."
59	0	I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.
60	0	"We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States."
61	0	They have really taken advantage of the United States.
62	0	Billions of dollars has been paid to them.
63	0	And we won’t let that happen.
64	0	"But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power."
65	0	Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.
66	0	And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.
67	0	So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.
68	0	"Today, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home."
69	0	"We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases."
70	0	But we don’t control our own border.
71	0	So we’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.
72	0	"And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is."
73	0	"It was one of many, by the way; not my only one."
74	0	"We’re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before."
75	0	"You look at other economies — they’re doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally."
76	0	"The market is up tremendously today, not that that’s anything, but, you know — because I’ll go back in and they’ll say, ""Oh, the market just went down."""
77	0	But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
78	0	We have all the records.
79	0	We have every record.
80	0	But we’re getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records.
81	0	"So our country is doing very well, economically."
82	0	And we’ve done a lot.
83	0	"But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border."
84	1	"When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry."
85	0	It’s wrong.
86	0	It’s wrong.
87	0	It’s just a lie.
88	0	It’s all a lie.
89	0	They say walls don’t work.
90	1	Walls work 100 percent.
91	0	"Whether it’s El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd."
92	0	"And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas."
93	0	And I asked them.
94	0	"I said, ""Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?"""
95	0	"You were there, some of you."
96	1	It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.
97	0	You know what they did.
98	0	But that’s only one example.
99	0	There are so many examples.
100	1	"In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall."
101	0	And they had 23 murders.
102	1	"It’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico."
103	1	So everyone knows that walls work.
104	0	"And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly."
105	0	You just take a look.
106	0	Almost everywhere.
107	0	Take a look at Israel.
108	0	They’re building another wall.
109	0	"Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent."
110	0	"That’s what it would be with us, too."
111	0	The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.
112	0	They go around the wall and in.
113	0	Okay?
114	0	That’s what it is.
115	0	It’s very simple.
116	0	And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don’t go through ports of entry.
117	0	They can’t go through ports of entry.
118	0	"You can’t take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking."
119	0	You can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.
120	0	You can’t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.
121	0	They open the door.
122	0	They look.
123	0	They can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.
124	0	They go through areas where you have no wall.
125	0	Everybody knows that.
126	0	Nancy knows it.
127	0	Chuck knows it.
128	0	They all know it.
129	0	It’s all a big lie.
130	0	It’s a big con game.
131	0	"You don’t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that’s it."
132	0	"They can’t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there’s no barrier, and they come into the United States."
133	0	Welcome.
134	0	We’ve detained more people.
135	0	Our border agents are doing such incredible work.
136	0	Our military has been incredible.
137	0	We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.
138	0	We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.
139	0	It’s very successful.
140	0	"But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them."
141	0	And it’s very necessary.
142	0	We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.
143	0	They just are breaking.
144	0	They’re in the process of breaking up.
145	0	We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet.
146	0	We’ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.
147	0	I want to thank the President.
148	0	I want to thank Mexico.
149	0	They have their own problems.
150	0	"They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders."
151	0	Forty thousand.
152	0	"And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will."
153	0	"But I just want to thank the President, because he’s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up."
154	0	"We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people."
155	0	It’s largely broken up.
156	0	Others have gotten through.
157	0	"And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there."
158	0	"If we didn’t have the wall up, and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they’d be welcomed to the United States."
159	0	One of the things we’d save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.
160	0	"If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall."
161	0	So I’m going to be signing a national emergency.
162	0	And it’s been signed many times before.
163	0	It’s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.
164	0	It gave the Presidents the power.
165	0	There’s rarely been a problem.
166	0	They sign it; nobody cares.
167	0	I guess they weren’t very exciting.
168	0	But nobody cares.
169	0	"They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases."
170	1	"We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs."
171	0	We have some of the greatest people I know.
172	0	They’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.
173	0	The Angel Moms.
174	0	"Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms."
175	0	"One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we’re talking about killed, in the year of ’18."
176	0	"I said, ""I haven’t seen you before."""
177	0	"She said, ""No, I’m new."""
178	0	"I said, ""That’s too bad."""
179	0	It’s too bad.
180	0	It’s so sad.
181	0	"Stand up, just for a second."
182	0	Show how beautiful your girl was.
183	0	Thank you.
184	0	I have such respect for these people.
185	0	"Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families."
186	0	I have great respect for these people.
187	0	These are great people.
188	0	These are great people.
189	0	They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
190	0	"And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly."
191	0	And they’re not treated the way they should be.
192	0	They’re fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.
193	0	"We have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up."
194	0	Your husband was just killed in Maryland.
195	0	Incredible man.
196	0	Just killed.
197	0	Beautiful children — won’t be seeing their father again.
198	0	These are brave people.
199	0	These are people that — they don’t have to be here.
200	0	They don’t have to be doing this.
201	0	They’re doing it for other people.
202	0	"So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?"
203	0	I really do.
204	0	I want to thank you.
205	0	Incredible people.
206	0	"Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl."
207	0	"And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting."
208	0	"It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important."
209	0	"I said, ""Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country. It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers. And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list."""
210	0	And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.
211	0	Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.
212	0	"Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, ""How about a fine?"""
213	0	"And when I asked President Xi, I said, ""Do you have a drug problem?"""
214	0	"No, no, no. I said, ""You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you have no drug problem?"""
215	0	"No, we don’t have a drug problem.  I said, ""Why?"" ""Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs."""
216	0	End of problem.
217	0	What do we do?
218	0	We set up blue ribbon committees.
219	0	"Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time."
220	0	"So if we want to get smart, we can get smart."
221	0	You can end the drug problem.
222	0	You can end it a lot faster than you think.
223	0	"But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs."
224	0	And it’s a criminal penalty.
225	0	And the penalty is death.
226	0	"So that’s, frankly, one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth."
227	0	I think maybe there’s no more important point.
228	0	We’re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.
229	0	"It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope."
230	0	Their market is down close to 40 percent.
231	0	Our market is way up.
232	0	"We’ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth."
233	0	Trillions.
234	0	Many trillions.
235	0	And China has lost trillions of dollars.
236	0	But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.
237	0	So we’ll see what happens.
238	0	"China is coming here next week, by the way."
239	0	"They’re coming home, the traders."
240	0	And then China is coming here next week.
241	0	And then I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.
242	0	"We’ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves."
243	0	"So, we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency."
244	1	"And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable."
245	0	"And by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times."
246	0	"President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels."
247	0	Criminal cartels.
248	0	It’s a very good emergency that he signed.
249	0	And we’re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.
250	0	So that would be a second national emergency.
251	0	"But, in that case, it’s already in place."
252	0	And what we want — really want to do — is simple.
253	0	It’s not like it’s complicated.
254	0	It’s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.
255	0	We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.
256	0	Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.
257	0	"I mean, nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border."
258	0	"And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes."
259	0	"You know, I hear a lot of people say, ""Oh, well. But maybe the previous administration…"""
260	0	"Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast."
261	0	We would have been down the tubes.
262	0	The regulations were strangling our country.
263	0	Unnecessary regulations.
264	0	By creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what’s going on today; it’s through the roof.
265	1	"What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before."
266	0	"And we’ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it’s a massive number of people."
267	0	"If we had the wall, it would be very easy."
268	0	We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.
269	0	"We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row."
270	0	You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent.
271	0	"We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol."
272	0	"You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things."
273	0	Law enforcement and Border Patrol.
274	0	"And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE."
275	0	ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.
276	0	"And, by the way, we’re going to be taking care of ICE."
277	0	"You know, we talk about the new bill."
278	0	We’re going to be taking care of ICE.
279	0	They wanted to get rid of ICE.
280	0	And the bill is just the opposite of that.
281	0	A lot of good things happened.
282	0	"So, that’s the story."
283	0	We want to have a safe country.
284	0	"I ran on a very simple slogan: ""Make America Great Again."""
285	1	"If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again."
286	0	"But we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment."
287	0	We haven’t been given the walls.
288	0	"And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff."
289	0	Ports of entry.
290	0	"We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it."
291	0	I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us.
292	0	It’s crazy.
293	0	"The only place they don’t want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000."
294	0	"Sounds like a lot, but it’s not so much, although we’re putting it to much better use than it used to be."
295	0	"A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn’t build or they didn’t do what they could have done."
296	0	It would have been great.
297	0	"It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession."
298	0	And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.
299	0	People that should have stepped up did not step up.
300	0	"They didn’t step up, and they should have."
301	0	Would have been easy.
302	0	"Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier."
303	0	But some people didn’t step up.
304	0	But we’re stepping up now.
305	0	So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.
306	0	"Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall."
307	0	We’re getting it done.
308	0	We’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.
309	0	"And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new."
310	0	That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.
311	0	"In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay."
312	0	But we’re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.
313	0	So — and we need new wall.
314	0	So I want to thank everybody for being here.
315	0	"I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here."
316	0	Thank you very much.
317	0	We have great respect for you.
318	0	"The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you."
319	0	So I just want you to know that.
320	0	I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having.
321	0	I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.
322	0	"Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly."
323	0	And we’re giving you a lot of surplus.
324	0	"We’re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving, previous to this administration."
325	0	But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.
326	0	"And as we get it, as you know, we send it down."
327	0	And you have much better protection.
328	0	But I really appreciate you being here.
329	0	So the order is signed.
330	0	And I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.
331	0	"And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there."
332	0	"And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling."
333	0	"And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake."
334	0	"And we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban."
335	0	"They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won."
336	0	"And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban."
337	0	Because we have a ban.
338	0	It’s very helpful.
339	0	"Madam Secretary, is that right?"
340	0	"Without the ban, we’d have a bigger problem."
341	0	"We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world."
342	0	And we won.
343	0	"But somebody said, ""President Trump lost on the ban."""
344	0	"Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court."
345	0	He — he didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.
346	0	They didn’t want to say that.
347	0	They didn’t want to go that far.
348	0	They were saying how I lost.
349	0	"The person sitting right up here — ""Donald Trump lost on the ban."""
350	0	"Yeah, I did."
351	0	"And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too."
352	0	And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.
353	0	Didn’t want to take it that far.
354	0	"But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too."
355	0	"The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we’re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs."
356	0	"And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters."
357	0	Thousands.
358	0	They’re out of this country.
359	0	We take them out by the thousands.
360	0	And they are monsters.
361	0	Okay.
362	0	Do you have any questions?
363	0	Yeah.
364	0	"John, go ahead."
365	0	Mr. President — (inaudible).
366	0	"AIDE:  Yes, we do."
367	0	There you go.
368	0	You were prepared.
369	0	"Mr. President, a lot of the money —"
370	0	Were you saying I was prepared?
371	0	With the microphone and prepared for questions.
372	0	"Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared."
373	0	I couldn’t believe you said that.
374	0	(LAUGHTER)
375	0	"No, no, no."
376	0	(LAUGHTER)
377	0	People don’t like saying that.
378	0	You were prepared for questions.
379	0	I am prepared.
380	0	I’m always prepared.
381	0	A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that’s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.
382	0	"How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?"
383	0	Yeah.
384	0	"So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military."
385	0	"Some of them haven’t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important."
386	0	I was speaking to a couple of them.
387	0	They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.
388	0	"I said, ""What were you going to use it for?"""
389	0	"And I won’t go into details, but it didn’t sound too important to me."
390	0	"Plus, if you think, I’ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion."
391	0	"And we’re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot."
392	0	"And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted."
393	0	"And they weren’t spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money."
394	0	"So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it’s going to be pretty big too, because there’s few things more important than our military."
395	0	"You know, I’m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military."
396	0	It was very badly depleted.
397	0	"And we’re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment."
398	0	We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before.
399	0	"But when you think about the kind of numbers you’re talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in."
400	0	"And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs."
401	0	"And that’s part of it, too."
402	0	We’re taking a lot of money from that realm also.
403	0	"But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we’re asking for."
404	0	"Yeah, go ahead."
405	0	Go ahead.
406	0	ABC.
407	0	Not NBC.
408	0	I like ABC a little bit more — not much.
409	0	"Come on, ABC."
410	0	Not much.
411	0	Pretty close.
412	0	"Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?"
413	0	Marco Rubio has made this point.
414	0	"Well, not too many people."
415	0	Yeah.
416	0	Not too many people have said that.
417	0	But the courts will determine that.
418	0	"Look, I expect to be sued."
419	0	I shouldn’t be sued.
420	0	Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.
421	0	"And then other people say, ""Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?"""
422	0	We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.
423	1	It’s an invasion.
424	1	"We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it’s very hard to stop."
425	0	"With a wall, it would be very easy."
426	0	So I think that we will be very successful in court.
427	0	I think it’s clear.
428	0	"And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?"
429	0	Fifty-six?
430	0	"There are a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent."
431	0	And many of those are far less important than having a border.
432	0	"If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country."
433	0	"You know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don’t create a border for our own country."
434	0	"So I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process."
435	0	"And, happily, we’ll win — I think."
436	0	Go ahead.
437	0	Let’s go.
438	0	"Let’s hear it, NBC."
439	0	Come on.
440	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
441	0	"I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, ""The whole concept of executive order, it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run."""
442	0	"You said, ""You’re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal."""
443	0	"Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you’re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?"
444	0	No.
445	0	"Look, I went through Congress."
446	0	I made a deal.
447	0	I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.
448	0	He’s not going to get one dollar.
449	0	"Well, I got $1.4 billion."
450	0	But I’m not happy with it.
451	0	"I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things."
452	0	The purchase of drug equipment.
453	0	More than we were even requesting.
454	0	"In fact, the primary fight was on the wall."
455	0	"Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money."
456	0	"But on the wall, they skimped."
457	0	"So I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster."
458	0	I could do the wall over a longer period of time.
459	0	I didn’t need to do this.
460	0	But I’d rather do it much faster.
461	0	And I don’t have to do it for the election.
462	1	"I’ve already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020."
463	0	"And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do."
464	0	"And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense."
465	0	"And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all."
466	0	Okay.
467	0	"Yes, ma’am, go ahead."
468	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
469	0	Thank you.
470	0	Roberta Rampton from Reuters.
471	0	I wanted to ask about China.
472	0	Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?
473	0	"Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?"
474	0	"I mean, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China."
475	0	"And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent."
476	0	"Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they’re building plants all over the United States."
477	0	It’s a beautiful thing.
478	0	"And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel."
479	0	"You know, you can do without certain industries."
480	0	Our country cannot do without steel.
481	0	"So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate."
482	0	"And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs."
483	0	And I haven’t even started.
484	0	"Now, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay."
485	0	"You know, it’ll be a whole different story."
486	0	"They won’t be paying that, but we’ll have a fair deal."
487	0	There won’t be intellectual property theft.
488	0	There won’t be so many other things that have gone on.
489	0	And no other President has done this.
490	0	"No other — you know, we didn’t have a deal with China."
491	0	"You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that’s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster."
492	0	It was a total disaster for our country.
493	0	"And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal."
494	1	"And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that’s United States, Mexico, Canada — that’s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall."
495	0	And nobody wants to talk about that.
496	0	"Because we’re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal."
497	0	"Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they’ll say — one of the things I’m thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they’ve built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, ""What a lousy deal; that’s a terrible deal."""
498	0	"Like, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time."
499	0	"And the Democrats said, ""Oh, should’ve gotten more."""
500	0	"When I made that deal, I said, ""This is incredible."""
501	0	"I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors."
502	0	They had to change their top management.
503	0	But they had to pay over a billion dollars.
504	0	"I said, ""What a deal."""
505	0	It took like a week.
506	0	And the Democrats didn’t even know there was a problem with ZTE.
507	0	I’m the one that find them.
508	0	I’m the one that settled it.
509	0	Over a billion dollars.
510	0	And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.
511	0	"And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time."
512	0	"The Democrats went out and said, ""Oh, they should’ve done better."""
513	0	"So what I’m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives."
514	0	"And we’ll all go down together, and what we’ll do is we’ll negotiate."
515	0	I’ll put them in the room and let them speak up.
516	0	"Because any deal I make with China, if it’s the great — it’s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I’m not going to have a deal."
517	0	It’s a very simple.
518	0	"But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, ""Oh, it should’ve been better. It should’ve been better."" "
519	0	And you know what?
520	0	That’s not acceptable to me.
521	0	So I’m thinking about doing something very different.
522	0	I don’t think it’s ever been — I just don’t want to be second-guessed.
523	0	But that’s not even second-guess; that’s called politics.
524	0	"Sadly, I’d probably do the same thing to them, okay?"
525	0	"But any deal I make toward the end, I’m going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi."
526	0	"I’m going to say, ""Please join me on the deal."""
527	0	"And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row."
528	0	"Please stand up, Bill."
529	0	(APPLAUSE)
530	0	Such an easy job he’s got.
531	0	He’s got the easiest job in government.
532	0	Thank you and congratulations.
533	0	That was a great vote yesterday.
534	0	Thank you very much.
535	0	Mr. President —
536	0	"Yes, go ahead."
537	0	Go ahead.
538	0	"In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would’ve preferred that this be done."
539	0	Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?
540	0	And —
541	0	"Well, I’m learning."
542	0	"I mean, I am learning."
543	0	"Don’t forget, it’s not like I’ve done this for — a senator came into my office and said, ""Sir, I’ve been running for office for 30 years. I’ve won seven out of seven. I did lose a couple when I was younger."""
544	0	"I said, ""Well, I’ve won one out of one. But, you know, I never did politics before. Now I do politics."""
545	0	"I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster."
546	0	"Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir?"
547	0	But I’ve learned — who?
548	0	Speaker Ryan.
549	0	Let’s not talk about it.
550	0	Okay.
551	0	What difference does it make?
552	0	But they should have pushed it faster.
553	0	They should have pushed it harder.
554	0	And they didn’t.
555	0	They didn’t.
556	0	"If they would have, it would have been a little bit better."
557	0	"In the meantime, I’ve built a lot of wall."
558	0	"I have a lot of money, and I’ve built a lot of wall."
559	0	But it would’ve been nice to have gotten done.
560	0	"And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that’s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform — not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things."
561	0	We have a real problem.
562	1	We have catch-and-release.
563	1	You catch a criminal and you have to release them.
564	0	We have so many other things.
565	0	"You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members — because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle — they’re all in."
566	0	You know what happened on the West Side Highway.
567	0	"That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured — nobody talks about that — horribly — like, loss of legs and arms — going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York."
568	1	He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.
569	1	It’s called chain migration.
570	0	And then you have the lottery.
571	1	"It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery."
572	0	It’s common sense.
573	0	"If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want."
574	0	The lottery system is a disaster.
575	0	I’m stuck with it.
576	0	"Mr. President, could you tell us —"
577	0	It should have — wait.
578	0	It should have never happened.
579	0	Okay.
580	0	"Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?"
581	0	I would talk about it.
582	0	"Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do."
583	0	Not of me.
584	0	"If I changed my views, he wouldn’t be with me."
585	0	Rush Limbaugh — I think he’s a great guy.
586	0	Here’s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.
587	0	Try doing that sometime.
588	0	"For three hours, he speaks."
589	0	He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.
590	0	"I mean, this guy is unbelievable."
591	0	Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.
592	0	Taking calls is easy.
593	0	"Okay, I’ll answer this one. I’ll answer that one."
594	0	"He goes for three hours, and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic."
595	0	Should they be —
596	0	Wait —
597	0	"Should they be deciding policy, sir?"
598	0	They don’t decide policy.
599	0	"In fact, if I went opposite — I mean, they have somebody — Ann Coulter."
600	0	I don’t know her.
601	0	I hardly know her.
602	0	I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.
603	0	"But the press loves saying ""Ann Coulter."""
604	0	"Probably, if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice."
605	0	I just don’t have the time to speak to her.
606	0	I would speak to her; I have nothing against her.
607	0	"In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, ""Donald Trump."""
608	0	And the two people that asked her that question smiled.
609	0	"They said, ""You’re kidding, aren’t you?"""
610	0	Nope. Donald Trump.
611	0	"So I like her, but she’s off the reservation."
612	0	But anybody that knows her understands that.
613	0	But I haven’t spoken to her.
614	0	I don’t follow her.
615	0	I don’t talk to her.
616	0	"But the press loves to bring up the name ""Ann Coulter."""
617	0	And you know what?
618	0	I think she’s fine.
619	0	I think she’s good.
620	0	But I just don’t speak to her.
621	0	Laura has been great.
622	0	Laura Ingraham.
623	0	Tucker Carlson has been great.
624	0	I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.
625	0	I have some on MSNBC.
626	0	"The other day, they did a great report of me."
627	0	"I said, ""Where the hell did that come from?"""
628	0	I think it was the only one in over a year.
629	0	"So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen — 52 percent in the polls."
630	0	It’s my highest poll number.
631	0	And people get what we’re doing.
632	0	They get it.
633	0	They really get it.
634	0	And I’m honored by it.
635	0	Yes.
636	0	Jim Acosta.
637	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
638	0	"I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what’s happening at the border — calling it an ""invasion,"" talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on — and yet there’s a lot of reporting out there, there’s a lot of crime data out there, there’s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low —"
639	0	That’s because of us.
640	0	But it’s still —
641	0	— that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels —
642	0	Excuse me.
643	0	It’s still massive numbers of crossings.
644	0	— that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.
645	0	What do you say —
646	0	"You don’t really believe that stat, do you?"
647	0	Do you really believe that stat?
648	0	"What do you — well, let me ask you this —"
649	0	Take a look at our federal prisons.
650	0	"I believe in facts and statistics and data, but —"
651	0	Okay?
652	0	Any more?
653	0	"Quick, let’s go."
654	0	"Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you’re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn’t get it through other ways?"
655	0	I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?
656	0	Do you think I’m creating something?
657	0	"Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons."
658	0	Okay?
659	0	This is real.
660	0	Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.
661	0	You’re CNN.
662	0	You’re fake news.
663	0	You have an agenda.
664	0	The numbers that you gave are wrong.
665	0	Take a look at our federal prison population.
666	0	"See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens."
667	0	Just see.
668	0	Go ahead and see.
669	0	It’s a fake question.
670	0	Yes.
671	0	Go ahead.
672	0	Can I ask a follow-up?
673	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
674	0	"Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics — numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government — show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most —"
675	0	There’s not violence on the border?
676	0	There’s not as much violence as —
677	0	"Oh, really?"
678	0	Let me — wait a minute.
679	0	Wait a minute.
680	0	Wait —
681	0	You had 26 people killed —
682	0	"Let me finish the question, please."
683	0	"Let me finish the question, please."
684	0	"Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border —"
685	0	I understand what you’re — I understand what you’re saying.
686	0	— a mile away from where I went.
687	0	I was there.
688	0	I understand.
689	0	That’s not the question.
690	0	The question is —
691	0	Do we forget about that?
692	0	"No, I’m not forgetting about it."
693	0	"I’m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down."
694	0	Okay.
695	0	So what do you base your facts on?
696	0	"Okay, let me — come on, let’s go."
697	0	Sort of — sort of —
698	0	"And, secondly —"
699	0	"No, no."
700	0	You get one.
701	0	You get one.
702	0	Ready?
703	0	"Well, the second question is —"
704	0	Just sit down.
705	0	Wait.
706	0	Sit down.
707	0	Sit down.
708	0	Could you please answer it?
709	0	Sit down.
710	0	You get one question.
711	0	"I get my numbers from a lot of sources — like Homeland Security, primarily."
712	0	And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.
713	0	And you know what else is a disaster?
714	0	"The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month."
715	0	Billions and billions of dollars.
716	0	And it’s unnecessary.
717	0	"So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?"
718	0	"No, no."
719	0	I use many stats.
720	0	I use many stats.
721	0	Could you share those stats with us?
722	0	"Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use."
723	0	"But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security."
724	0	"All right, next question."
725	0	And do you — wait a minute.
726	0	Just a quick follow-up.
727	0	Go ahead.
728	0	No.
729	0	Go.
730	0	Please.
731	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
732	0	I just want to bring you back to China for a second.
733	0	The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.
734	0	"The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide."
735	0	"Are you eyeing a possible extension — 30 days, maybe 60 days?"
736	0	What is the status there?
737	0	Or is March 1st the deadline?
738	0	Yeah.
739	0	Very good question.
740	0	So it’s a very big deal.
741	0	"I guess you could say it’s like — must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think."
742	0	"Trade with China, how big does that get?"
743	0	"Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there."
744	0	But it’s very complicated.
745	0	"There are many, many points that we’re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they’re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them."
746	0	There is a possibility that I will extend the date.
747	0	"And if I do that, if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now."
748	0	I would not increase the tariffs.
749	0	"Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it’s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office."
750	0	Now it’s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.
751	0	What are your plans to reverse it?
752	0	"Well, it’s all about growth."
753	0	But before I —
754	0	(Inaudible.)
755	0	"— really focus on that — and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined."
756	0	"So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined."
757	0	Combine them all.
758	0	So you can’t be talking about that.
759	0	But I talk about it because I consider it very important.
760	0	"But first, I have to straighten out the military."
761	0	The military was depleted.
762	0	"And if we don’t have a strong military — that hopefully we won’t have to use because it’s strong — if we don’t have a strong military, you don’t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems."
763	0	So I have to straighten out the military.
764	0	That’s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.
765	0	But growth will straighten it out.
766	1	"You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down."
767	0	"Everybody said, ""What happened?""  Well, what’s happening is growth."
768	0	"But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military."
769	0	And we have no choice but to straighten out our military.
770	0	"Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)?"
771	0	"Yes, ma’am, go ahead."
772	0	"Thank you, Mr. President."
773	0	"On North Korea — back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement."
774	0	Yes.
775	0	"I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit."
776	0	And then —
777	0	A lot.
778	0	— are we going to be seeing anything concrete —
779	0	A lot has been accomplished.
780	0	Okay.
781	0	— on denuclearization.
782	0	Yeah.
783	0	A lot has been accomplished.
784	0	"We’re dealing with them, we’re talking to them."
785	0	"When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama."
786	0	And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.
787	0	It was supposed to be 15 minutes.
788	0	"As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that."
789	0	"And I said, ""What’s the biggest problem?"""
790	0	"He said, ""By far, North Korea."""
791	0	"And I don’t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea."
792	0	I think he was ready to go to war.
793	0	"In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea."
794	0	And where are we now?
795	0	No missiles.
796	0	No rockets.
797	0	No nuclear testing.
798	0	We’ve learned a lot.
799	0	"But much more importantly than all of it — much more important — much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship."
800	0	I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.
801	0	And I’ve done a job.
802	0	"In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize."
803	0	"He said, ""I have nominated you…"" or ""Respectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize."""
804	0	"I said, ""Thank you."""
805	0	Many other people feel that way too.
806	0	"I’ll probably never get it, but that’s okay."
807	0	They gave it to Obama.
808	0	He didn’t even know what he got it for.
809	0	He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.
810	0	"He said, ""Oh, what did I get it for?"""
811	0	"With me, I probably will never get it."
812	0	"But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people."
813	0	Nobody talk about that.
814	0	They don’t talk about that.
815	0	"Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists."
816	0	"And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, ""Please, please."""
817	0	"And I thought — I said, ""No, it can’t happen. What are you talking about?"""
818	0	"No, they’re going to get…"
819	0	"And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into — to really — to really do big destruction."
820	0	"And I put out a statement that ""you better not do it."""
821	0	"And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack."
822	0	"Or they’re doing it surgically, at least."
823	0	Saved a lot of people.
824	0	We do a lot of good work.
825	0	"This administration does a tremendous job, and we don’t get credit for it."
826	0	But I think the people understand what we do.
827	0	"So Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean, it’s the most beautiful five letter — five-page letter."
828	0	Nobel Prize.
829	0	He sent it to them.
830	0	You know why?
831	0	Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.
832	0	And they had alarms going off; you know that.
833	0	"Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe."
834	0	I did that.
835	0	And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.
836	0	Fire and fury.
837	0	Total annihilation.
838	0	"My button is bigger than yours and ""my button works."""
839	0	Remember that?
840	0	You don’t remember that.
841	0	"And people said, ""Trump is crazy."""
842	0	And you know what it ended up being?
843	0	A very good relationship.
844	0	I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.
845	0	Nobody else would have done that.
846	0	The Obama administration couldn’t have done it.
847	0	"Number one, they probably wouldn’t have done it."
848	0	"And number two, they didn’t have the capability to do it."
849	0	So I just want to thank everybody.
850	0	"I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life."
851	0	(LAUGHTER)
852	0	"Bill, good luck."
853	0	A tremendous reputation.
854	0	I know you’ll do a great job.
855	0	Thank you very much.
856	0	"And thank you, everybody."
857	0	Thank you very much.
858	0	Thank you.
